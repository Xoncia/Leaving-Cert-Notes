# Revision Sheets (Fiches de révision)

## Pronunciation (Prononciation)

- In French, the final letter is not pronounced except when it has an accent on it: é/è/ê/ë
  - Ex: mang**e** ≠ (not pronounced the same as) mang**é**
- The letters << ill >> are most of the time pronounced like a « y » sound (like in the word yellow) except for the word « ville >>
  - Ex: trava**ill**er = (pronounced like) travayé
- The final « s » are not pronounced
  - Ex: dan**s** = (pronounced like) dan
- When you have a word ended by the same « s » as in « les/des/dans/vous/nous » and arriving before a word with a vowel as the first letter, you have to create a link between them by making a « z » sound
  - Ex: les amis = (pronounced like) lézami

## Grammar and Syntax (Grammaire et syntaxe)

- French sentences are composed of: Subject + Verb + Object. If you're missing one of these elements you need to add it
  - Ex: La maison grande -> La maison **est** grande
- Mots féminins: Words ended by « ée/esse/ette/ienne/tion/ice/elle » are almost always feminine
  - Ex: poup**ée** -> une poup**ée**
- Don't forget to mathc adjectives with the gender and the verb they complete:
  - Ex: Mon amiest **beau** -> Ma aim**e** est **belle**
- Try to complexify your sentences by using words such as « that/which/who/... » = que/qui in French
  - Ex: J'ai une grande famille **qui** est composée de ma mère, mon père et mes frères et sœurs. J'ai aussi un chien **que** j;aime beaucoup
