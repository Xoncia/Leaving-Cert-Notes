# Woodwind Family

The wind section of the orchestra is traditionally known as the woodwind section even though not all the instruments are made of wood

Situated behind the string family in the orchestra

There are two main types of woodwind instruments which are flutes and reed instruments:

### Flutes

Flutes produce sound by directing a focused stream of air below the edge of a hole in a cylinder shaped tube. Flutes can be divided into two sub-types, open flutes and closed flutes

### Reeds

Reeds produce sound by focusing air into a mouthpiece which then causes a reed or reeds to vibrate. Reed instruments can be split into two sub-types, single reed and double reed
