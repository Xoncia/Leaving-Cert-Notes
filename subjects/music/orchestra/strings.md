There are two sections of violins in the orchestra, the 1st and the 2nd section

The 1st section carry the melody and the 2nd section support the melody with harmonies or other melodic support

When played, the violin is held under the chin and the fingers on the left hand press the string on the neck to produce different sounds when the string are plucked or bowed

## Technique

There are two ways which musicians cam play stringed instruments, with a bow or plucked with their fingers

Two techniques we are going to listen to and discuss today are pizzicato and staccato

## Pizzicato
