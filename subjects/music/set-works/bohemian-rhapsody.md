## Keywords

| Term | Definition |
|-|-|
| A capella | Unaccompanied vocals |
| Bends | Guitar technique in which a note is allowed in pitch but pushing the string up and down |
| Falsetto | Vocal effect mainly by males singing in a way high pitch |

## Processing Effects

| Technique | Description |
|-|-|
| Distortion | Overloading the speaker to create a harsh, fuzzy sound. Rock performers did this deliberately to achieve a rougher sound. Distortion can be created in a recording studio, through the guitar amplifier or by using a distortion pedal. |
| Flanging | Two of the same tracks are played together, but one of the tracks is slowed down, taking it out of sync with the first, creating a swooshing sound. |
| Panning | Panning allows producers to split and direct sound through the right or left of the stereo field. When panning is applied to recordings, different instrumental sections or parts of the music will be heard out of either the right or the left speaker. Panning is easy to identify when listening to music through headphones as the sound feels as though it is switching from one ear to the other. |
| Reverberation | Reverberation occurs naturally in large enclosed spaces such as concert halls or large churches. The music creates an echo which slowly fades. This effect can be artificially applied to a recording. Adding reverb to recordings helps to mimic the feel of a live performance. |
| Multi-tracking and Overdubbing | Multi-tracking, often in combination with overdubbing (recording another layer over previously recorded material), allows artists to record a rich and full texture in the music. It also allows singers or musicians to record their parts separately, listening back to previous tracks as they record the next one. When all the tracks have been recorded, they can be mixed together to produce a final track. Queen used 24 tracks to record ‘Bohemian Rhapsody. |
| Bouncing | This is when two or more pre-recorded tracks are combined together on to one new track. This frees up tracks for recording more parts. |

## Performing Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-|-|
| Bends | Guitar technique in which a note is allowed in pitch but pushing the string up and down |
| Vibrato | Shaking the finger which holds down the string on the guitar's fretboard |
| Power Chords | Power Chords are created when the root note is doubled and the fifth notes of chord is played too. The third note of the chord is left out |
| Glissando | Sliding the finger that is holding down a string up or down on the fretboard after that string has been plucked, this creates the sound of sliding from one pitch to another |
| A capella | Vocal performance by a soloist or group of vocalists with no accompaniment |
| Antiphony | Antiphony is a form of dialogue between parts. Two parts or voices interact, irritating each other in quick succession. The melody is often passed from one part to the other |
| Falsetto | A male vocalist singing above his natural vocal range |
| Crash Cymbal | The crash cymbal produces a thin, bright, cutting sound. Part of a standard drum kit, the crash cymbal is a type of suspended cymbal |
