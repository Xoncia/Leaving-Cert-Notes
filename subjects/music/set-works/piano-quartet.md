# Piano Quartet No. 1 by Gerald Barry

## Compositional Techniques

| Technique | Description | Occurs in Section(s) |
|-|-|-|
| Canon | Created when a melody is imitated by one or more parts at a fixed distance + interval contains 2, 3, 4, 5, part canons. When parts overlap in this way polyphony is created | A, B2, E1, C5, C6, C7, C9, H |
| Inversion | Flipping the melody upside down, inverting its melodic shape. If a melody opens on a descending scale, it's inversion will open with an ascending scale | A |
| Retrograde | A retrograde results from the rewriting and performing of an original melodic line in reverse. In this quartet, Barry has created the thematic material for E1 by using the retrograde of D1 | E1, F + C8 |
