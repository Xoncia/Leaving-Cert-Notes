# Piano Quartet No. 1 by Gerald Barry

## Compositional Techniques

| Technique | Description | Occurs in Section(s) |
|-|-|-|
| Canon | Created when a melody is imitated by one or more parts at a fixed distance + interval contains 2, 3, 4, 5, part canons. When parts overlap in this way polyphony is created | A, B2, E1, C5, C6, C7, C9, H |
| Inversion | Flipping the melody upside down, inverting its melodic shape. If a melody opens on a descending scale, it's inversion will open with an ascending scale | A |
| Retrograde | A retrograde results from the rewriting and performing of an original melodic line in reverse. In this quartet, Barry has created the thematic material for E1 by using the retrograde of D1 | E1, F + C8 |

## Introduction

- The Piano Quartet was first performed in London in 1992
- Example of 20th Century contemporary quartet for 4 instruments (Piano, Violin, Viola, Cello)
- Popular form of chamber music in the Baroque + classical eras
- Takes inspirations from Irish trad melodies and 
  - Sí Bheag Sí Mhór
  - Tis the Last Rose of Summer
  - Beidh Aonach Amórach
  - Lord Mayo is Delight
- These melodies are used in many different ways to help Barry's own style and interpretation of the music
- Melodies become unrecognisable
- Pushes boundaries of compositions such as <u>no local centre</u> (not major or minor)
  - no recognised form (structure)
  - use of new instrumental and compositional techniques

## The main function of the piano:

- Creates contrasting textures with strings
- Double string parts - very often
- Plays one or more voices in <u>canon</u>
- Introduces dissonance
- Plays note cluster
- Solo section - "Hommage Á horowitz"

## Instruments Techniques

- Open strings
- Hand clusters on piano
- Harmonics - delicate whispey sound
- Détaché - detached - Separate bow for each note
- Flautando - Bow over the fingerboard

## Form

- Quartet begins and ends with music that is heard only once
- Section C is centre of piece occur occuring 9 times but never the same
- One movement - 18 sections
- Eight themes (4 appear once)
- A, B1, C1, C2, B2, C3, D1, D2+B3, E1, C4, C5, E2+D3, C6, C7, F
- Unusual form - doesn't fit a standard one
- Ends with 3 new sections (F, G, H) - unusual

## Tonality

- Mainly Atonal
- Section A is pentatonic (no 7th notes)
- B+B1 refer to key of C
- C1 is in A flat
- E2+D3 only section with noted key signature (B flat minor)

## Rhythmic Features

- Over 330 time signature changes
- Unusual time signatures 1/8
- Complex rhythmic patterns
- Irregular rhythms + patterns
- Metronome marks for tempo changes
- Polymetry - Combining different metres simultaneously

## Compositional Features

- Canon
- Retrograde -> Melody played backwards (E1 is retrograde of D2)
- Augmentation -> Note values are lengthened, usually doubled (C8)
- Diminuation -> Note values are shortened (B1 notes are halved in B3)
- Wedging -> Making intervals bigger (C2+C3)
- Splicing -> Making intervals smaller (C2+C3)
- Inversion -> Melody turned upside down
- Counterpoint -> Combining 2 themes - polyphonic (D2+B3)
- Telescoping -> Fragments of previous sections in a short section (Section G)
