The elements of music are:
1. Instrumentation

2. [Dynamics](dynamics.md) 
3. [Beat/Pulse/Tempo](beat.md)
4. Pitch
    - How high or low a specific sound is
5. Mood/Expression
    - The way the song makes you feel
6. [Melody](melody.md)
7. Rhythm
    - Patterns of long and short sounds and silences within the music. Rhythm is written onto sheet music using note values
    - Example:

8. Timbre (Texture)
    - The distinctive sound qualities that different instruments/voices make. It is what makes two instruments sound different when they are both playing the same note at the same volume
