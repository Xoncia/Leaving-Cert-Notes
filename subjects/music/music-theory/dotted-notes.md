♩. (1 and 1/2 beats) = ♩ (1 beat) + ♪ (1/2 beats)

## Dotted Crotchet

The dotted crotchet is always followed by a single quaver like this: ♩. ♪

Memory Aid: Mother crosses a road with her child. They always go together, the child following the mother. The dotted crotchet is the mother. The child is the quaver.
