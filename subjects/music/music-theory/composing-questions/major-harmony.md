# Major Harmony - Question 5

- Chords I, IV and V are major
- Chords ii and vi are minor
- Do NOT use chords iii or vii
- Chord VI must only be used in root position

## Cadences

- Perfect = V-I
- Imperfect = anything to V
- Plagal = IV-I
- Interrupted = V(or V7)-vi

## Chords

| Chord | Moves Well to Chord |
|-|-|
| I | ii, IV, V, vi |
| ii | V |
| IV | I, ii, V |
| V | I, IV, V7, vi |
| v7 | I, vi |
| vi | ii, IV |

### Good Chord Progressions

- i-vi-IV-V-I
- i-IV-ii-V

- Chords that move by step: I-ii
- Chords which fall in thirds: vi-IV, IV-ii
- Chords that rise in fourths: I-IV, ii-V

### Chords Progression to Avoid

- V7-V
- ii-I
- V-ii

(V-ii you must no do, ii-I cannot be done)

## Prep Work

- Write out your chord bank in the major key
- Write out the bass notes
- Add the 7th to Chord V (V7)
- Don't double the 3rd of a major chord
- Don't use chords iii or vii
