# Minor Harmony - Question 5

- Chords i and iv are minor
- Chords V and VI are major
- Do NOT use chords iii or vii
- Chords ii is diminished and can ONLY be used in the first inversion (iib)
- Chords VI must only be used in root position

## Cadences

- Perfect = V-i
- Imperfect = anything to V
- Plagal = iv-i
- Interrupted = V(or V7)-VI

## Chords

| Chord | Moves Well to Chord |
|-|-|
| i | ii·b, iv, V, V7, VI |
| ii·b | V, V7 |
| iv | i, ii·b, V, V7 |
| V | i, iv, V, V7 |
| V7 | i, iv, VI |
| VI | ii·b, iv |

### Good Chord Progressions

- i-iv-V-VI
- V-i-iv-V-VI
- iv-i-ii·b-V

### Chord Progressions to Avoid

- ii·b-i
- V-ii·b

(V-ii you must not do, ii-i cannot be done)

## Prep Work

- Write out your chord bank in the minor key (add the 7th to Chord V)
- Write out the bass notes in the minor key
- Watch out for the raised 7th check back over your work and make sure you have the accidental
