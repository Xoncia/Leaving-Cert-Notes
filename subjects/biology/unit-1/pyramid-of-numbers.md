# Pyramid of Numbers

## Use of Pyramid of Numbers

Ecological pyramids are used to compare different communities of the ecosystem by comparing trophic levels and looking at energy structure by counting individuals at each level

# Pyramid of Numbers

In general:
_

## Energy transfer through an ecosystem

![]()

## Normal Pyramid of Numbers

A reminder of what a pyramid of numbers looks like

![]()

## Limitations of use

The size of organisms is not consider in a pyramid of numbers e.g. one rose bush can support thousands of greenfly

![]()

## A distorted Pyramid of Numbers

A similar problem arises with parasites - numerous parasites on one host - resulting in a distorted pyramid

![]()

## An inverted Pyramid of Numbers

When organism size is not considered very unusal pyramid shapes are likely to occur

## Competition for resources
Plants:
- compete for light,
- water
- minerals and space
Animals:
- compete for food
- water
- shelter
- territory
- mates
## Two types of competition
### 1: Contest Competition
involves an active physical confrontation between two organisms - one wins
#### Example
<u>Two dogs fighting over a bone</u>

One may have stronger muscles and sharper teeth and so win the bone
![]()

### 2: Scramble Competition
<u>This is where each organism tries to acquire as much of the resource as possible</u>
#### Example
<u>An ivy plants and a hawthorn tree may compete for light</u>

The ivy uses adventitious roots to grip the hawthorn and climb higher

## Competition and Population Size
- <u>Restricts population</u> size
- Survival of the fittest
- Is a driving force behind evolution i.e. **adaptive techniques** (sharp teeth of carnivores or climbing abilites in ivy)

## Predation

Predation: the act, of some animals (predators), of capturing and killing othr animals for food

<u>Predator:</u> animals that hunts, captures and kills other animals (prey) for food

Predators have evolved adaptive techniques to survive, e.g. wolf has keen hearing and eyesight, strong muscles, sharp teeth, camouflage and hunts in packs

### Positive Effects of Predation
1. Stabilises the community. Keeps population numbers under control
2. Predators control the number of heribovres and so prevent overgrazing
3. Predators eliminate the less well adapted (weaker) prey

### Adaptations of Predators
- Keen senses and sharp teeth
- <u>Catch easiest prey - old and sick (less energy used)</u>
- Change diet to suit prey available e.g. foxes
- <u>Live and hunt in packs</u>
- Migrate to where prey is plentiful
- <u>Camouflage</u>

Three examples of Adaptations of Predators:
1. Hawks have excellent eyesight
2. Ladybirds have strong mouth parts
3. <u>Cheetahs can run at 60 km/h</u>
4. <u>Wolves are sharp teeth</u>
5. <u>Lions have excellent sense of smell</u>

### Predator / Prey Relationship (Wolf / Deer in Alaska)

![]()

#### Notes on Graph
1. When the deer population increased, the wolf population had more food and increased too
2. As the wolf population increased, the number of deer being killed increased - resulting in a decline in the deer population
3. When the deer population declined, there was less food for the wolves and they declined in numbers too
4. This led to an increase in the deer population

## In Summary: Predator/Prey Relationships
- As prey INCREASES, predators INCREASES
- As there are more predators the prey will DECREASE and then therefore predators DECREASE
- Eventually numbers of prey will increase, starting the cycle once more

## Parasitism

![]()

<u>Parasitism: When one organism (the parasite) benefits from another (the host) and does harm to it</u>

E.g. 
- Fleas on a dog (ectoparasites)
- Liverfluke in cattle/sheep (endoparasites)

Parasites do harm to their hosts but usually do not kill them too quickly

## Symbiosis

<u>Symbiosis ("living together"): where two organisms of different species have a close, _</u>
