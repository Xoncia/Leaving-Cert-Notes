# Title: Investigate the effect of pH on the rate of enzyme activity

## Materials/Equipment/Apparatus

- Celery
- Scalpel
- Weigh boat
- Electric balance
- Cutting board
- Buffer pH solution
- Washing up liquid
- Graduated cylinder
- Beaker
- Boiling Tubes
- Water bath
- Thermometer
- Water
- Hydrogen Peroxide

## Procedure/Method

1. Chop the celery into fine pieces using the scalpel. Weigh 5g and get 5g of chopped celery
2. Add 20ml of the buffer pH solution, a drop of washing up liquid and the 5g of celery into your graduated cylinder
3. Put 2ml of hydrogen peroxide into a boiling tube
4. Set up your water bath to be 25Â°C and place the graduated cylinder and the boiling tube into the water bath and wait 2 minutes
5. Pour the hydrogen peroxide into the graduated cylinder and record the volume of the graduated cylinder
6. Wait 2 minutes and record the final volume of the graduated cylinder

## Safety/Risks

- Hydrogen Peroxide can cause burns and is corrosive
- Tie back hair
- Wear googles
- Wear gloves
- Only handle the Hydrogen Peroxide only when you need to

## Results

## Conclusion

As the pH increases enzyme activity increases. (Teacher's Conclusion)

We have found out that enzyme activity is different depending on the pH level and that enzyme activity is highest when there is a pH of 10 with 5ml of foam and lowest when there is a pH of 4 with 1ml of foam. (My Conclusion)
