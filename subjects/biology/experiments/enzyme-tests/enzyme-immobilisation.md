# Title: Prepare one enzyme immobilisation and examine its application

## Materials/Equipment/Apparatus (+ Chemicals)

- Retort stand
- Plasic bottle (bioreacter)
- Beakers
- Measuring cylinder
- Syringe
- Sieve
- Calcium chloride
- Sodium alginate
- Yeast (sucrase (enzyme))
- Sucrose (substrate)
- Clinistix
- Water
- Stirring tool

## Procedure/Method

### A. Preparing the Immobilised Enzyme

1. Add 0.4g of sodium alginate and 10 ml of water to a beaker and stir
2. Add 2g of yeast and 10ml of water to a beaker and stir
3. In a large beaker, add a reasonable amount of water and calcium chloride
4. Add the yeast suspension to the alginate solution
5. Draw 20ml of the liquid into a syringe
6. From the height of 10 cm, release the mixture into the calcium chloride one drop at a time. Then wait 10 minutes for the drops to harden

### B. Application (Using the Immobilised Enzyme)

1. Filter the hardened beads with a sieve and rinse the beads with water
2. Pour the beads into the plastic bottle
3. Dissolve 0.5g of sucrose in 50ml of water and pour it into the bottle
4. Immediately pour out some product and test the product in a beaker with a glucose strip
5. Repeat the test every 2 minutes until glucose appears in the beaker
6. Run off the remaining product from the bottle into a beaker and look at it’s turbidity (cloudiness)

## Conclusion

We have found out that immobilised enzymes can’t function and work as they typically work compared to free enzymes.
