# Title: Conduct any activity to demonstrate osmosis

## Materials/Equipment/Apparatus

- Water
- Visking Tubing
- Beakers
- Sucrose Solution
- Funnel
- Weighing Scales

## Procedure/Method

1. Soak the visking tubing in water to soften it
2. Make a knot on both visking tubings
3. Fill one half of visking tubing with sucrose using funnel and another half of different visking tubing with water using a funnel
4. Get rid of as much air as possible and then knot the open end of the visking tubings
5. Tie the two ends of the visking tubings together
6. Record the turgidity and weight of the visking tubings
7. Put each of the visking tubings in a beaker filled with water for 15 minutes
8. Take about the visking tubings, dry them and then record the turgidity and weight of the visking tubings 

## Safety/Risks

- Tie back hair

## Conclusion

Water travels from an area of high concentrations to an area of low concentrations across a semi-permeable barrier. This process is called Osmosis.
