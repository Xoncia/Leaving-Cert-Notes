# Homeostasis

Definition: Homeostasis is the maintenance of a contstant internal environment for our cells

- Your body and it’s individual cells need just the right conditions to perfrom at their best
- A cell’s delicately balanced chemical reactions work best within narrow limits of temperature, pH, solute concentration etc.

Simple aquatic organisms (like Amoeba and seaweeds) obtain their food, water and oxygen directly from the water that surrounds them

More complex organisms carry their own internal sea inside them (the tissue fluid), which is in contact with all the living cells of the body

## Homeostasis

Homeostasis means “controlling internal conditions”

### Waste products need to be removed — how?

| Waste Product | How it's made and removed                                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CO2           | "Produced by respiration (release of energy from food), removed via lungs"                   |
| Urea          | "Produced by liver breaking down amino acids, removed by kidneys and transferred to bladder" |


### Internal conditions need controlling — how?

| Internal Condition             | How it's controlled                               |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Temperature                    | "Increased by shivering, decreased by sweating"   |
| Ion (salts and sugars) content | "Increased by eating, lost by sweating + urine"   |
| Water content                  | "Increased by drinking, lost by sweating + urine" |
| Blood glucose                  | Increased and decreased by hormones               |


## Why Do We Need Homeostasis

Homeostasis is necessary if an organism is to be independent of its surroundings, and if it’s metabolism is to function efficiently

Most homeostatic mechanisms work by negative feedback, i.e. if there is a change away from the normal optimum value, action is automatically taken to reverse this change

## Homeostasis - Temperature Regulation

Temperature influences the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions that sustain life

Mammals and birds are endotherms (warm blooded): they have a fairly constant body temperature

(insert pictures here)

They can operate in low temperature environments, as they can keep the rate of enzyme activity high

Most animals are ectotherms (cold blooded) - their body temperature varies with the external temperature e.g. fish, amphibians, reptiles

### Controlling Body Temperature

(insert pictures here)

Body temperature is controlled by the thermo-regulatory centre in the brain. It is kept at 37°C as this is the best temperature for enzymes to work in. If the body becomes too hot then blood vessles dilate and sweat glands release sweat. If the body is too cold then blood vessels constrict and muscles start to shiver.

## Homeostasis - Body Temperature

- Control of body temperature is an example of how homeostasis works in humans
- Our normal core body temperature is maintained at 37°C the heat being mainly produced from the liver during its metabolism
- Muscles, skin and blood all play a role in controlling body temperature
