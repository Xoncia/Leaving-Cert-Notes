# Pyramid of Numbers

## Use of Pyramid of Numbers

Ecological pyramids are used to compare different communities of the ecosystem by comparing trophic levels and looking at energy structure by counting individuals at each level

# Pyramid of Numbers

In general:
_

## Energy transfer through an ecosystem

![]()

## Normal Pyramid of Numbers

A reminder of what a pyramid of numbers looks like

![]()

## Limitations of use

The size of organisms is not consider in a pyramid of numbers e.g. one rose bush can support thousands of greenfly

![]()

## A distorted Pyramid of Numbers

A similar problem arises with parasites - numerous parasites on one host - resulting in a distorted pyramid

![]()

## An inverted Pyramid of Numbers

When organism size is not considered very unusal pyramid shapes are likely to occur

## Competition for resources
Plants:
- compete for light,
- water
- minerals and space
Animals:
- compete for food
- water
- shelter
- territory
- mates
## Two types of competition
### 1: Contest Competition
involves an active physical confrontation between two organisms - one wins
#### Example
<u>Two dogs fighting over a bone</u>

One may have stronger muscles and sharper teeth and so win the bone

### 2: Scramble Competition
<u>This is where each organism tries to acquire as much of the resource as possible</u>
#### Example
<u>An ivy plants and a hawthorn tree may compete for light</u>

The ivy uses adventitious roots to grip the hawthorn and climb higher

## Competition and Population Size
- <u>Restricts population</u> size
- Survival of the fittest
- Is a driving force behind evolution i.e. **adaptive techniques** (sharp teeth of carnivores or climbing abilites in ivy)
