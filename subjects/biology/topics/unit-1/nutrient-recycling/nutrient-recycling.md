# Nutrient Recycling

## Need to Know
Define the term: nutrient recycling by organisms
1. Outline and draw the carbon cycle
2. Outline and draw the nitrogen cycle

There is a limited amount of nutrients in Earth e.g. you are probably aware of the water cycle - where water is constantly being recycled in nature. There are similar cycles for all nutrients.

When plants and animals die, their nutrient content is not wasted.

Bacteria and fungi decompose the remains and release the nutrients back into the abiotic environment (i.e. into the soil, nearby water and air)

These nutrients are then taken up by other plants and used to make new organic material.

This material is passed on down the food chains and is reused by all the chain members

When death occurs for these members, the nutrients are again returned to the abiotic environment and the cycling of nutrients continues in this circular way

(insert recycling nutrients with an ecosystem diagram here)

This ensures that there is no real long term drain on the Earth's nutrients, despite millions of years of plant and animal activity

## The Carbon Cycle

**Carbon** forms part of all organic nutrients - carbohydrates, fats and proteins

Carbon Dioxide is <u>removed</u> from the environment by photosynthesis in plants, and under certain conditions, over long periods of time, some of these plants may form fossil fuels such as coal, oil, peat, and natural gas

Carbon dioxide is <u>returned</u> to the environment by:
1. Respiration in plants, animals & micro-organisms
2. Decay caused by micro-organisms
3. Combustion i.e. burning fossil fuels

## The Nitrogen Cycle

All organisms need nitrogen for protein, DNA and RNA manufacture

78% of the Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen gas, but it cannot be used in this form by plants and animals

Nitrogen gas must first be 'fixed', i.e. changed to a suitable form (ammonia or nitrate) before it can be used

### Nitrogen Fixation

- **Nitrogen-Fixing bacteria** in the soil convert N₂ gas in the air into ammonia (NH₃). This accounts for the majority of all N₂ fixation

## Summaty & Nitrogen Cycle
1. Nitrogen (N₂) in the air is converted to Nitrates (NO⁻ ₃) by Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria / lightning and are absorbed by plants + eaten by animals
2. Animals excrete Ammonia (NH₃) and release it when they die
3. Nitrification - Bacteria turn Ammonia (NH₃) into (nitrites (NO⁻ ₂) and then turn into) Nitrates (NO⁻ ₃)
4. Denitrifcation - Bacteria turn Nitrates (NO⁻ ₃) into Atmospheric Nitrogen (N₂)

(insert dodo pic here)

Have you seen one of these recently?

It is a Dodo and has been extinct since 1681

How did it happen?

### What is Conservation?

<u>Conservation is the protection and wise management of natrual resources and the environment</u>

#### Benefits of Conservation

#### One converservation practice from one of the following areas

| Area | Conservation Practice |
|-|-|
| <u>Agriculture</u> | _ |
| <u>Fisheries</u> | _ |
| <u>Forestry</u> | _ |
_

##### Agriculture

One conservation practice from one of the following areas is required:

- <u>Mixed Farming</u>
- <u>Crop Rotation</u>
- <u>Biological Controls</u>
- <u>Gene Banks</u>

#### Biological Controls

**What are Biological Controls?**

Biological Control is a method of controlling pests (including weeds) and diseases in agriculture that uses living organisms (predation, parasitism) rather than introduced chemicals

##### Conservation and Biological Controls

- Ladybird larva eating woolly apple aphids

**Advantages:**

- No chemical used
- No chemical residues left on plants
- No leaching of chemicals into soil or water courses
