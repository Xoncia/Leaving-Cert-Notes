## Role of Photosynthesis

- Plants use it to make food
- Animals get their food from plants
- It produces oxygen which is needed in respiration to release energy
- It is responsible for forming fossil fuels
- It removes carbon dioxide from the air

![]()

Stoma is singular. Stomata is plural.

- Large and flat *
- Thin *
- Chloroplasts located close to upper epidermis
- Stomata
- Airspaces
- Veins *

## Balanced Equation for Photosynthesis

Chemical Equation: 6CO<sub>2</sub>+6H<sub>2</sub>O+light -> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>+6O<sub>2</sub>

Word Equation: Carbon Dioxide + Water + Light -> Glucose + Oxygen

- CO<sub>2</sub> = Carbon Dioxide
- H<sub>2</sub>O = Water
- C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> = Glucose
- O<sub>2</sub> = Oxygen

Checking if the equation is balanced

| Side 1 | Side 2 |
| 6 x C | 6 x C |
| 18 x O | 18 x O |
| 12 x H | 12 x H |

## Ultra structure of the Chloroplast

![]()

The thylakoids contain the chlorophyll which traps the sun's energy

<!--card--> 

## Photosynthesis requires

- Carbon dioxide
- Water
- Light energy
- Chlorophyll

<!--card--> 

## Photosynthesis produces

- Glucose
- Waste Oxygen

<!--card--> 

## Photosynthesis converts

light energy -> chemical energy

<!--card--> 

## Stages in Photosynthesis

- Light is absorbed
- Water is split
- Products are produced (4 protons, 4 electrons and oxygen)
- Light energises electrons
- Glucose is formed

<!--card--> 

## Light is absorbed

- The **light** that reaches a plant is **trapped by chlorophyll**
- **Chlorophyll** is found in the **chloroplasts** of plant cells
- Therefore **photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts**
- The trapped light provides the energy the plants need to make glucose

<!--card--> 

## Water is split

- Some of the trapped light energy is used to split water into oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) protons (H+) and electrons (e-)
- Summarised as 2H<sub>2</sub>O -> 4H+ and 4e- and O<sub>2</sub>

<!--card--> 

## What happens to these Products?

1. The electrons are passed to chlorophyll
2. The protons are stored in a proton pool for later use
3. The oxygen may pass out of the leaf into the atmosphere or else may be used for plant respiration

<!--card-->

## Light Energises Electrons

- The electrons that were passed to the chlorophyll become energised by some of the trapped light energy - this changes them into high energy electrons

<u>Glucose is formed</u>

- The high energy electrons along with protons from the proton pool are combined with carbon dioxide to form glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)

## Sources of light for plants

- Sunlight is the natural source of light for plants but they can use artificial light for photosynthesis
- **<u>Artificial light</u> is often used in greenhouse stimulate growth**
- Increasing the **light** can increase growth up to a certain **saturation point** where no more light can be absorbed and photosynthesis will level off

<!--card-->

## Sources of carbon dioxide for plants

- Plants have 2 sources of carbon dioxide one is external the other is internal
- Plants get most of their carbon dioxide from the atmosphere this is external
- Plants get carbon dioxide internally from their own cellular respiration
- Sometimes artificial sources of carbon dioxide are used to stimulate growth e.g. burning gas in a green house

<!--card-->


## Sources of water for plants

- Water is absorbed from the soil by the roots of plants
- This water passes up the stem and is used for photosynthesis
