# Genetic Inheritance

## Definitions

- Heredity - The passing of features from one generation to the next
- Genetics - The study of **heredity**
- Fertilisation - <u>The fusion of male and female gametes to form a diploid zygote</u>
- Gametes - <u>Haploid cells capable of fusion</u>

## Terms

| Terms | Definition |
|-|-|
| Monohybrid | One trait |
| Bihybrid | Two traits |
| Homozygous | Same form (two identical alleles) |
| Heterozygous | Different (two different alleles) |

## Sex Chromosomes

- We have 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs
- <u>Autosomes</u> are <u>non sex chromosomes</u> - We have <u>44</u> Autosomes (no. 1 - 22)
- The other <u>2</u> chromosomes are the <u>sex chromosomes</u>: the <u>X chromosome</u> and the <u>Y chromosome</u>
- Males have XY
- Female have XX
- All embryos start life as female

## Alleles

- Alternative forms of **<u>genes</u>**
- Units that determine heritable traits
- HAIR COLOUR is the GENE
- BLOND, BLACK, RED are all ALLELES
- CHIN is the GENE
- SQUARE and ROUND are the ALLELES

## Genetic Terms

- Alternative forms of **<u>genes</u>**
- **Dominant alleles (TT - tall pea plants)**
- **<u>Dominant (uppercase letter) - allele that is always expressed if present</u>**
- **Recessive (lowercase letter) alleles (tt - dwarf pea plants)**
- **<u>Recessive - the allele that is prevented from being expressed by dominant allele</u>**

## Phenotype

- Outward appearance
- <u>Physical</u> characteristics
- Examples:
1. Tall pea plant
2. Dwarf pea plant
3. Brown eyes

**Genotype** = Genetic make up of an organism

- TT (homozygous dominant)
- tt (homozygous recessive)
- Tt (heterozygous)

**Non-nucleur DNA** = DNA which is found in mitochondria and chloroplast which can also be inherited via the egg ovum

Most DNA is found in chromosomes in the nucleus

(Only the head of the sperm fuses with the egg so if we get DNA from mitochondria it comes from the egg)

## Punnett Square

- A punnett square is used to show the possible combinations of agmetes
- T = tall pea plant
- t = dwarf plant
- Phenotype of parent = Tall pea plant x Dwarf pea plant
- Genotype of parent = TT x tt
- Genotype of gamete = ![TT x tt Punnett Square](genetic-inheritance/punnett-square.png)
- Genotype of progeny (first generation of progeny) = Tt
- Phenotype of F. = Tall plants (all)]
- Mendel's first law of segregation: Genes separate during gamete formation
- Gametes fuse together
- F1 generation together ![Tt x Tt Punnett Square](genetic-inheritance/punnett-square-2.jpg)
- Genotype of F2 progeny = TT Tt Tt tt
- Phenotype of F2 progeny = 3 Tall, 1 dwarf

### Incomplete dominance (codominance)
