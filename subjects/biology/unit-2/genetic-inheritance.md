# Genetic Inheritance

## Definitions

- Heredity - The passing of features from one generation to the next
- Genetics - The study of **heredity**
- Fertilisation - <u>The fusion of male and female gametes to form a diploid zygote</u>
- Gametes - <u>Haploid cells capable of fusion</u>

## Sex Chromosomes

- We have 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs
- <u>Autosomes</u> are <u>non sex chromosomes</u> - We have <u>44</u> Autosomes (no. 1 - 22)
- The other <u>2</u> chromosomes are the <u>sex chromosomes</u>: the <u>X chromosome</u> and the <u>Y chromosome</u>
- Males have XY
- Female have XX
- All embryos start life as female

## Alleles

- Alternative forms of **<u>genes</u>**
- Units that determine heritable traits
- HAIR COLOUR is the GENE
- BLOND, BLACK, RED are all ALLELES
- CHIN is the GENE
- SQUARE and ROUND are the ALLELES

## Phenotype

- Outward appearance
- <u>Physical</u> characteristics
- Examples:
1. Tall pea plant
2. Dwarf pea plant
3. Brown eyes

## Genetic Terms

- Alternative forms of **<u>genes</u>**
- **Dominant alleles (TT - tall pea plants)**
- **<u>Dominant (uppercase letter) - allele that is always expressed if present</u>**
- **Recessive (lowercase letter) alleles (tt - dwarf pea plants)**
- **<u>Recessive - the allele that is prevented from being expressed by dominant allele</u>**

| Monohybrid | One trait |
| Bihybrid | Two traits |
| Homozygous | Same form (two identical alleles) |
| Heterozygous | Different (two different alleles) |
