# Respiration

​Definition: Respiration is the release of energy from food​
​
- The food involved in respiration is usually glucose​
- Internal respiration is controlled by enzymes which allow energy to be released in small amounts​
- <u>The energy is trapped in molecules called ATP</u>

## Types of Respiration​
- <u>**Aerobic Respiration** – the release of energy from food in the presence of oxygen</u> Example: Humans
- <u>**Anaerobic Respiration** The release of energy from food without requiring the presence of oxygen</u> Example: Yeast

### Aerobic Respiration​
- Most living things get energy from aerobic respiration and are called <u>**AEROBES**</u>
- The <u>energy stored in bonds in glucose</u> is <u>released and used to make ATP​</u>
- <u>When ATP breaks down it supplies energy for all the reactions in a cell</u> such as movement of muscles, growth of new cells etc.
#### Equation for Aerobic Respiration​
Chemical Reaction: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> -> 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + Energy

Word Equation: Glucose + Oxygen -> Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy

- Aerobic respiration is <u>relatively efficient</u>, 40% of the energy in glucose is used to make ATP
- Any energy not used to produce ATP is <u>lost as heat</u>

## Energy Carriers
There are two main groups of Energy Carriers

Group 1
- a) ADP <u>**(Adenosine diphosphate)**</u> = <u>low energy molecule, found in cells of all organism</u>
- b) ATP <u>**(Adenosine triphosphate)**</u> = <u>high energy molecule, stores and transports energy</u>

Remember ATP is a source of energy for most cell reactions

<u>ATP stores energy and transfers it to where it is needed</u>

Group 2
- a) NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) = low energy
- b) NADH- = high energy molecule

### Reactions
ATP + water -> ADP + P + energy i.e. Respiration

- Phosphorylation is the addition of phosphate to a molecule (+P) 
- Molecules with letter P are used in Photosynthesis

## Aerobic Respiration
Aerobic Respiration occurs in 2 stages:
- Stage 1: Glycolysis
- Stage 2: Krebs Cycle

### Stage 1 - Glycolysis​

![Glycolysis 1](respiration/glycolysis-1.png)

- Takes place in the cytosol (the cytoplasm without the organelles) as enzymes are found here
- Doesn't require oxygen
- It only releases small amounts of energy
- Is the same for both aerobic and anaerobic respiration
- A 6 carbon carbohydrate (Glucose) is converted to two 3- carbon molecules with the release of a small amount of energy
- Most of the energy in the glucose molecule remains stored in each 3- carbon molecules
