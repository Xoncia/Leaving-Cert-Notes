## Cell Continuity

<u>Definition: Cell continuity (= cell division) means that all cells develop from pre-existing cells</u>

3 steps to form a new cell

1. Produce materials it will need
2. Grow larger
3. Reproduce to form a new cell

## Chromosomes

- <u>Definition: Chromosomes are structures in the Nucleus, made of DNA & Protein</u>
- Not dividing = Chromatin (long thing threads)
- When dividing = Chromatin forms a numbers of clearly distinguishable Chromosomes
- Each species has a definite no. of Chromosomes, Humans = 46 chromosomes
- Each Chromosome has 1000s of genes (Check out human genome project). Each cell in the human body contains about 25,000 to 35,000 genes

## Haploid

<u>Definition: A Haploid cell has one set of each type of chromosomes</u>, ie. has only one set of each type of chromosomes in the nucleus

Haploid is symbolised by <u>letter 'n'</u> and number of chromosomes in the cell is given as <u>n=23</u>

In humans, eggs and sperm are haploid n=23

## Diploid

<u>Definition: A diploid cell has two sets of each type of chromosomes</u>, ie. It has two of each type of chromosome in the nucleus

Chromosomes are in pairs in diploid cell, called homologous pairs. (Both chromosomes same size and shape)

(Homologous = same length, similar)

Diploid is symbolised as '2n' and total no. of chromosomes in cell is given as 2n=46. This means there are 23 pairs of chromosomes

## Somatic Cells

- <u>Somatic cells are normal body cells</u> of an advanced organism and contain two sets of chromosomes (not sex cells)

Somatic Cells -> Diploid
Sex Cells -> Haploid
