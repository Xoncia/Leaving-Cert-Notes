## Important Definitions

| Terms | Definitions |
|-|-|
| Triplet (codon) | A sequence of three bases |
| Genetic code | <u>A sequence of three bases</u> (codon or triplet) that represents a code for an amino acid |
| Gene | <u>A section of DNA</u> that has the code for the production of protein |
| Complementary bases | Complementary bases are when each base has a different corresponding base (or bases that match each other) |
| Nucleotide | A nucleotide consists of a phosphate group , deoxyribose (sugar) and a nitrogen base |
| Polynucleotide | A polynecleotide are many nucleotides joined together |
| Anti codon | A sequence of three bases on the tRNA that complement three bases on the mRNA |
| DNA profiling | DNA profiling makes a pattern of DNA bands of a person, which can be used to distinguish that DNA from other DNA |
| Restriction enzymes | Restriction enzymes are used to cut the DNA into different fragments |
| Genetic screening | The testing of DNA for an altered gene | 
| Protein synthesis | The making of a protein |
| Translation | The making of a protein using the mRNA code |
| Transcription | The making of mRNA from DNA |
| Purines | Double ringed molecules e.g. adenine and guanine |
| Pyrimidines | Single ringed molecules e.g. cytosine and thymine |
| Non coding DNA | They **don't have a code** for the formation of a protein. Non-coding DNA is also known as **junk DNA** |
