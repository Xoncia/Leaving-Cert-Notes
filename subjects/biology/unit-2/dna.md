# DNA and RNA

## Structure of DNA

DNA = **d**eoxribo**n**ucleic **a**cid

- DNA is located inside the nucleus of a cell.
- DNA can fit into a nucleus as it can coil and fold.
- DNA has two strands.

**NOTE:** DNA is also found in the **mitochondria** and **chloroplast** of cells

There are four bases used in DNA:

- **A** = adenine
- **T** = thymine
- **G** = guanine
- **C** = cytosine

What is meant by the term **complimentary base pairs?**

- These are **bases that match** (correspond) with each other.
- Adenine joins with thymine
  - A -> T
- Guanine joins with Cytosine
  - G -> C
- **A**pples (adenine) in the **t**rees (thymine), **C**ar (cytosine) in the **g**arage (guanine)

What shapes does DNA have?

- DNA has a **double helix shape**

What is a gene?

- A gene is a **section of DNA** that has the code for the production of protein

## The Genetic Code

- **What is the genetic code?** It is a **sequences of three bases** (codon or triplet) that represents a code for an amino acid
- **How many common amino acids are used in the production of proteins?** 20
- A gene carries different codes to control the formation of the different amino acids.
- Examples:
  - A DNA triplet **CAA** is the code for the amino acid called **valine**
  - A DNA triplet **CGA** is the triplet for an amino acid called **alanine**

What is non-coding DNA?

- They **do not have a code** for the formation of a protein
- Non-coding DNA is also known as **junk DNA**.

<!--card-->

What is the structure of a nucleotide?

- DNA is made up of units called nucleotides

Sugar is Deoxyribose = D

Phosphate group = P

Nitrogen base = A or G or T or C

<!--card-->

What is a polynucleotide?

- It is many nucleotides joined together

<!--card-->

What holds base together?

- Bases are held together by a **hydrogen bond**
- Adenine and thymine form **two** weak hydrogen bonds.
- Guanine and cytosine form **three** hydrogen bonds.

What are purines and pyrimidines?

- There are four nitrogen bases, two are known as **purines** and two as **pyrimidines**.
- Two **purine** bases are (double ringed molecules): adenine (A) and guanine (G)
- Two p**y**rimidine bases are (single ringed molecules): th**y**mine (T) and c**y**tosine (C)

What scientists discovered the shape and structure of DNA?

- Frances **Crick** and James **Watson**
