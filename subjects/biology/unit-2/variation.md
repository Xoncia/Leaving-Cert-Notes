# Variation and Evolution

## Variation

Definition: **<u>Variation is differences between individuals of the same species</u>**

Variation in the population (even among family members) arises due to **Sexual Reproduction** and **Mutations**

### 1. Variation and **Sexual Reproduction**

a. Sexual reproduction in diploid organisms must involve **meiosis** to produce the **haploid gametes**. **<u>Independent assortment</u> of the homologous chromosome pairs during meiosis ensures great <u>genetic variation</u> among the <u>gametes</u>**. (Punnett Square)

For example, human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. *Either* **one** of each pair enters a gamete formation. Therefore a **gamete** could have the 'first' chromosome of one chromosome pair, and the 'second' chromosome of each of the other 22 chromosome pairs.

With 23 chromosome pairs, this means that there are about **8 million** possible combinations of chromosomes for each gamete formed.

b. **Random <u>fertilisation</u>** between the many **varied gametes (different eggs, different sperm) of two individuals leads** to huge genetic variation, ensuring that no two offspring will be genetically identical.

### 2. Variation and **Mutations**

Definition: **<u>A mutation</u> is a change in the amount or structure of DNA**
