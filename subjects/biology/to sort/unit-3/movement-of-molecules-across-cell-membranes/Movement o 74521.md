# Movement of Molecules Across Cell Membranes

# Selectively Permeable Membrane

- Phospho-lipid Bilayers
- Only allow certain substances in and out
- Occur as cell membrane & Nuclear 
membrane

# Three Methods (Click Below Headings)

## 1. Diffusion

- **Diffusion** _
- Diffusion is a **passive process, requiring no energy**

### Examples of Diffusion

- Smell of perfume
- A stink bomb!!
- Oxygen diffusing from the blood into the alveoli and carbon dioxide diffusing out of alveoli into blood-

## 2. Osmosis

- **Osmosis** is the movement of **water** from an area of high water concentration to an area of low water concentration across a **semi-permeable membrane**

(insert diagram here)

- Osmosis is a **passive process and does not require energy**

(insert diagram here)

Solute is a substance that dissolves in a solvent e.g. salt, sugar

### Artificial semi-premeable membranes

- Visking tubing and cellophane are artifical semi-premeable membranes and can be used to demonstrate osmosis

## Food Preservation

Food spoilage is caused by bacteria. To avoid food spoilage:

- Food can be placed in a high solute concentration e.g. sugar or salt solution
- This causes the water inside the food cells and inside the bacteria to leave due to osmosis
- This dehydration means the bacteria cannot function

## 3. Active Transport

**Active Transport** - The movement of **molecules** across a cell membrane **against** the concentration gradient i.e. from low concentration to high concentration

This process is active and requires energy

Cells involved in active transport have high energy requirements and contain many mitochondria

### Example of Active Transport:

- Uptake of glucose in villi of small intestine
