# Breathing System

## Objectives (What you will need to know from this section)

- Outline the macrostructure & function of the breathing tract in humans
- Outline the essential features of the alveoli & capillaries (as surface) for gas exchange
- Describe the mechanism of the breathing system in gas exchange
- Outline a breathing disorder: cause, prevention, treatment (Asthma/Bronchitis)

Respiration is the release of energy from our food (Chemical reaction)

- Humans need oxygen to carry out respiration (Aerobic respiration)

Breathing: We get fresh supplies of oxygen by breathingit in through our lungs (Physical process)

## Respiratory (Lung) System

(insert picture here)

Your lungs are enclosed (along with the heart) between the ribs and the diaphragm (the thorax)

The ribs form a protective cage of twelve pairs of bones

Intercostal muscles = attached between the ribs, move the rib cage up or down

The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle at the base of the rib cage

Diffusion is the movement of moleculs from a region of high concentration to a region of lower concentration

### Protection

1. The lining cells of the nose, trachea and bronchi produce a sticky mucus that traps dust and germs
2. [White blood cells](The%20Circul%20b5cc7.md) in the alveoli can engulf bacteria and foreign matter

### Adaptions of the Lungs for Gas Exchange

- Alveoli have a large surface area [90m squared]
- Short distance between air and blood
- Walls of alveoli are elastic

Inhaling means breathing in

(insert picture here)

1. The brain sends signals to the rib muscles and diaphragm to contract (breathing is involuntary)
2. The ribs are pulled up and out, and the diaphragm flattens downwards
3. The volume of the chest increases, so air pressure drops and more air is drawn into the lungs and alveoli

Exhaling means breathing out

(insert picture here)

Exhaling is a process that doesn’t require energy

1. The rib muscles and diaphragm relax, springing back to their original positions
2. Air pressure in the lungs increases, and air is pushed out from alveoli

### Gas Exchange in the Lungs & Tissues

---

Our voice box (larynx), is made of two sheets of muscle that vibrate as the air passes between them and so we can produce sounds and speech, in co-operation with our tongue, mouth and teeth

**Control of Breathing**

We breathe automaticallu by involuntary reflex action. It is controlled by madulla oblongata of the brain

The rate of breathing is contrinually adjusted to meet the body’s needs (an example of [homeostasis](Homeostasi%20fe226.md))
