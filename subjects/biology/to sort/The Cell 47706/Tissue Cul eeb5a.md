# Tissue Culture

Tissue culture is the growth of cells in or on a sterile nutrient, artificial medium outside of the body

In vitro means outside the body

In vivo means inside the body

### Examples:

1. **Growth of skin:** Skin is grown outside the body (often from stem cells) and new skin is grafted onto the wound
2. **Micropropagation:** Growth of large numbers of plants from cells of a parent plant. It's an inexpensive way to produce large numbers of similar plants
