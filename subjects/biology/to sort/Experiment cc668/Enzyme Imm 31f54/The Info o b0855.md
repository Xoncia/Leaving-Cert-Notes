# The Info on the "How to" Handout

## Steps:

1. In a beaker, add 0.4g of sodium alginate to 10ml of distilled water and stir
2. In a sepearte beaker, add 2g of yeast to 10ml of distilled water and stir
3. In a seperate large beaker, dissolve the calcium chloride in water
4. Add the yeast suspension to the alginate solution
5. Draw the liquid into a 20ml syringe
6. From a height of 10ml, release the mixture from the syringe into the calcium chloride ond drop at a time. Leave to harden for 10 minutes
7. Filter the hardened beads through a sieve and rinse with water
8. Mix 2g of yeast in 10ml of water and pour into one of the separating funnels
9. Pour the beads into the second funnel
10. Dissolve 1g of surcose in 100ml of water. Pour 50ml into each separating funnel
11. Immediately test the products in the beakers with glucose strips
12. Repeat test every 2 minutes until glucose appears in both beakers
13. Run off the remaining products from each funnel into the beakers and compare the turbidity (cloudiness) of the solution from both funnels
