# A Test for Starch

# Title: Conduct a Qualitative Test for Starch

### Materials/Equipment/Apparatus:

- 3 boiling tubes
- Test tube rack
- 2 droppers
- Starch solution
- Iodine Solution
- Bread Solution
- Water

### Procedure/Method:

1. Setup your boiling tubes in a test tube rack
2. Label one tube, bread, another, water and the last, starch solution
3. Add a reasonable and equal amount of starch solution, water and bread to their corresponding tubes (the water is our control)
4. Observe and write down the colour of each specimen
5. Suck up some iodine into a dropper and drop 2 - 3 drops into each tube (this iodine will test for starch)
6. Gently stir/shake each tube to mix the iodine and solutions well
7. Observe and write down the colours and results that the specimens change to
