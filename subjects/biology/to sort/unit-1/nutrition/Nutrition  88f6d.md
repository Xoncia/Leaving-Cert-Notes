# Nutrition (& Food)

Required for: Energy & Growth

## Metabolism

All the chemical reactions that take place within a living organism

Can be subdivided into:

- **Anabolic Reaction** = building up simple molecules into more complex molecules
    
    Example: Photosynthesis
    
    Simple → Complex
    
- **Catabolic Reaction** = breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones
    
    Example: Respiration & Digestion 
    
    Complex → Simple
    

## Food is required for:

1. Energy - Food is broken down in cellular respiration to produce energy
2. Provide building blocks for growth and repair of cells
3. Metabolism - to produce the chemicals that take part in and control all the chemical reactions occurring in the body

## Bio-Elements

6 Macro-nutrients (Main Elements): **CHONPS**

- Carbon (C)
- Hydrogen (H)
- Oxygen (O)
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorous (P)
- Sulfur (S)

5 Micro-nutrients (Mineral Elements):

- Sodium (Na)
- Magnesium (Mg)
- Chlorine (CI)
- Potassium (K)
- Calcium (Ca)

3 Trace Elements:

- Iron (Fe)
- Copper (Cu)
- Zinc (Zn)

## Bio-Molecules

Bio-Molecules - Chemicals that are made inside a living being

4 majors types found in food are:

- Carbohydrates
- Lipids
- Proteins
- Vitamins

## Carbohydrates

Elements: C, H, O

Smallest Unit: Monosaccharide's

Types:

- Starch - Stored in plants (Storage Role)
- Glycogen - Carbohydrate stored by animals (Storage Role)
- Cellulose - Found in cell walls of plants (Structural Role)

Metabolic Role - Broken down in respiration, provides energy

Food Sources:

- Breads
- Potatoes
- Rice
- Sugars
- Cakes
- Etc.

The general formula for a carbohydrate is 

$$
C_x(H_2O)_y
$$

There are twice as many hydrogen molecules as oxygen molecules

Most carbohydrates contain 6 carbons

### A common carbohydrate

General formula = $C_x(H_2O)_y$

When x = y = 6 (6 is the most common value for x and y)

We got the formula $C_6H_{12}O_6$

The name of this monosaccharide carbohydrate: Glucose

### Another common carbohydrate

General formula = $C_x(H_2O)_y$

When x = 12 and y = 11

We get the formula $C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$

The name of this disaccharide carbohydrate: Sucrose

## Lipids(Fats/Oils)

Fat/Oils are types of lipids

Elements: C, H, O

Smallest Unit: **Triglyceride** (One molecule of glycerol linked to three fatty acids)

Phospholipids: are fat like substances where one of the fatty acids is replaced by a phosphate group added to it 

![Untitled](Nutrition%20%2088f6d/Untitled%201.png)

Types:

- Animal Fats
- Plant Oils

Metabolic Role: Broken down in respiration to provide energy

Structural Role: Store energy/insulate

Dietary Source: butter, oils, margarine, cream, etc.

## Proteins

Elements: C, H, O, N

Proteins are composed of 20 common amino acids

Bond between amino acids is called a peptide bond

Smallest Unit: peptide

Peptide (<20 amino acids) - polypeptide(>20 amino acids) - protein(at least 200 amino acids)

Peptide → polypeptide → protein

Metabolic Role (folder proteins) - Used as enzymes to control reactions

Structural Role (fibrous proteins) - Found in e.g. keratin in hair, nails and feathers

Dietary Source: Meat, fish, egg, nuts, beans

Enzymes are substances that speed up or slow down reactions Example: Amylase (It is in saliva)

(Anabolic: small → big Catabolic (digestion): big → small)

## Vitamins

- Organic compounds
- Cannot be made in the body
- Must be taken in the diet
- Required in very small amounts
- Essential for correct functioning of the body
- Often act as co-enzymes
- Lack of a vitamin causes a deficiency disease
- Named by letters

### Water Soluble/Fat Soluble Vitamins

- Water Soluble

- Fat Soluble

- Vitamin C
- Source: Citrus Fruits

- Vitamin D
- Source: Dairy Products and Sunshine

- Functions:
    - Forms connective tissue such as skin and gums
    - Helps immune system

- Functions:
    - Helps to absorb calcium needed for healthy bones and teeth

- Deficiency: Scurvy = Poor healing of skin, gums. causing loss of teeth

- Deficiency: Rickets = weak deformed bones

## Minerals

- Inorganic nutrients in the form of dissolved salts.
- Humans:
    - Iron for haemoglobin
    - Calcium for healthy bones
- Plants:
    - Magnesium for producing chlorophyll
    - Calcium for cementing cell walls together

## Water

- $H_2O$ – most abundant liquid on earth, vital for all living things
- Properties:
    - Liquid at normal environmental temperatures
    - Transport medium
    - Solvent – lots of things dissolve in water
    - High heat capacity – slow to warm up or cool down
    - Surface tension

### Importance of Water

There are 2 groups of autotrophs
