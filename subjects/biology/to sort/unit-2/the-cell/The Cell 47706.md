# The Cell
The smallest unit of living matter

## Animal & Plant Cells - Basic Structure

### Animal Cells:

- Cell Membrane
- Cytoplasm
- Nucleus
- Mitochondria

Only the cell membrane, the cytoplasm and the nucleus can be seen under the light microscope

### Plant Cells:

- Cell Membrane
- Cytoplasm
- Nucleus
- Cell Wall
- Chloroplast
- Large Vacuole
- Mitochondria

## Cell Ultra-structure

The fine details of a cell's structure can only be seen using an electron microscope

Cytoplasm is the watery liquid inside the cell membrane

Organelles are small structures found in the cytoplasm
