# Genetics - Terms and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Species | Organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring |
| Heredity | The passing on of traits from parent to offspring by means of genes |
| Gene Expression | The process of using the information on the gene to make a protein |
| Gene | A unit of DNA which codes for the production of a specific protein |
| DNA profiling | Examining DNA / for a pattern or band / to compare **OR** A method of making a unique pattern of bands from the DNA of a person(, which can then be used to distinguish that persons DNA from other DNA) |
| Coding DNA | That part of the chromosome which carries the information to make a protein |
| Non-coding DNA | That part of the chromosome which doesn't carry the information to make a protein |
| Genetic screening | Testing (people) for the presence of a (specific) gene **or** to establish presence **or** absence of gene(s) |
| Transcription | The process of producing mRNA using DNA as a template |
| Translation | The process of making a protein using the mRNA code as a template |
| Gamete | A haploid sex cell which is capable of fusion |
| Fertilisation | The fusion of 2 (haploid) gametes to form a (diploid) zygote |
| Allele | An alternative form of a gene |
| Homozygous | Has identical alleles (for a trait) |
| Heterozygous | Has different alleles (for a trait) |
| Genotype | The genetic make-up of an individual |
| Phenotype | Physical appearance of an organism |
| Dominance | One allele masks the expression of the other |
| Recessive | Allele whose expression is masked by dominant allele |
| Incomplete Dominance | Neither allele masks the expression of the other |
| Variation | Difference between members of species **or** population |
| Mutation | Change in the genetic make up |
| Genetic Engineering | Manipulation or alternation of genes |
| Evolution | (Inheritable) change within a population (or species) / in response to change in the environment / by natural selection / overtime |

# Extended Study Genetics - Terms and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Mendel's 1st Law (Segregation) | Traits are controlled by pairs of alleles which separate at gamete formation. Each gamete carries only one allele for each trait |
| Mendel's 2nd Law (Ind.Assortment) | During gamete formation each member of a pair of alleles may combine randomly with either of another pair |
| Linkage | Genes located on the same chromosome (are said to be linked) |
| Sex Linkage | Gene located on X chromosome **or** on Y chromosome |
| Non-nuclear Inheritance | DNA apart from that found in the nucleus (e.g. mitochondria) that is passed on to the next generation |
