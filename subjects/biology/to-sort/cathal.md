## Incomplete Dominance

- F1 Hybrids have an appearance in between the phenotypes of 2 parental varieties
- Example: Snapdragon Plant

## Punnett Square

A punnett square is used to show the possible combinations of gamete

### Example of Punnett Square

- T = Tall
- t = Dwarf
- Phenotype - Tall X Dwarf
- Genotype - TT x tt

![TT x tt Punnett Square](genetic-inheritance/punnett-square.png)

- Genotype of F1 progeny Tt
- Mendel's 1st law of segregation
- Genes separate during gamete formation
- Gametes fuse together

---

- **Non-nuclear DNA** - DNA which is found in mitochondria and chloroplast which can also be inherited via the egg (ovum)
- Most DNA if found in chromosomes in the nucleus

![]()

Only the head of the sperm fuses with the egg, so if we get DNA from mitochondria it comes from the egg

## The genetic make up of the organism

Genotype = Genetic make up of an organism

Example:
1. Tall pea plant
  - TT = tall (homozygous dominant)
2. Dwarf pea plant
  - tt = dwarf (homozygous recessive)
3. Tall pea plant
  - Tt = tall (heterozygous)
