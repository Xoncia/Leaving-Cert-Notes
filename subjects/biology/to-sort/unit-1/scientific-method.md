## Scientific Investigations

- Curiosity and observations lead to an idea/explanation of how something works
- Investigations into whether the idea is correct or not happen
- Sometimes the idea is correct and sometimes the idea is wrong
- The idea is shared with others, so they can investigate also

## Scientific Method based on:

1. Making Observations
2. Forming a Hypothesis (suggested explanation-educated guess (Hypothesis (prediction) can be tested))
3. Design experiment
4. Collect & Interpret Data
5. Forming a conclusion
6. Communication (Publication in SCIENTIFIC Journals (on the internet is not accepted answer in LC exam))

## Example: Vaccinations

### Observation:

Milk maids do not get small pox (serious condition)

### Hypothesis:

Milk maids get cow pox (mild condition) which protects them from small pox

### Experiment:

Small boy was infected with cow pox and suffered cow pox. Two months later he was injected with small pox

### Result:

Boy did not suffer small pox

### Conclusion:

Cow pox protects from small pox. Cow pox fluid can be used to give immunity to small pox

## Scientific investigations lead to…

When a hypothesis is confirmed it can lead to a Theory

E.g. Theory of Evolution

When a theory is confirmed over many years it becomes a Scientific Principle

When a Principle is judged to be of great basic importance it is called a **Law**

E.g. Law of Gravity

Hypothesis → Theory → Principle → Law

## Limitations of the Scientific Method

Experiments are only based on current knowledge

Results are limited by our ability to interpret them

The natural world is in constant change (myxomatosis- rabbits now resistant to it)

### Dishonesty

In 1998, a report claiming MMR vaccine had links to autism

### Accidents

The discovery of viagra

### Sample Size

If the Sample Size is too small, results cannot be trusted

---

### Experimental Design – A Fair Test

- Large sample size (if possible)
- Only one variable changes (fair test)
- Other variables remain constant
- **Replicate:** Repeat many times to verify result
- Use a control (a setup for comparison)
- Data must stand up to independent scrutiny

    ## Ethics
    
    Throughout this course we will come across scientific issues which have ethical implications
    
    Ethical issues relate to what is right and what is wrong
