# Circulatory System

All larger organisms require a transport (vascular) system to bring food and oxygen to the cells and to remove waste

**Humans** have a **closed circulatory system** - blood circulates inside closed vessels (insects have an open system - open ended vessels). Blood can travel much faster in a closed system

## Blood Vessels - 3 Types

1. Arteries
- Brings blood down away from heart under high pressure
- Have **no valves** to stop backflow
- **Thick walls** to cope with high pressure
- **Narrow lumen** (space inside)
- Arteries carry oxygenated (high in oxygen, low in carbon dioxide) blood (except pulmonary artery)

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%201.png)

1. Veins
    - Brings blood to heart under lower pressure
    - Veins have valves to prevent backflow of blood
    - Veins have thinner walls
    - Veins have a larger lumen (space inside)
    - Veins carry deoxygenated (low in oxygen, high in carbon dioxide) blood (except for pulmonary vein)

1. Capillaries
- Thin wall - 1 cell thick
- Tiny blood vessels
- They allow materials to be exchanged between the blood and cells e.g. oxygen

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%204.png)

## Smaller Blood Vessels

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%205.png)

### Arterioles

- Arterioles connect arteries and capillaries

### Venules

- Venules connect capillaries to the veins

### Capillaries

- Tiny blood vessels linking arterioles and venules
- The thin wall allows easy exchange of materials with cells

## Comparison of vessels

### Blood Vessels Under the Microscope

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%207.png)

# Blood

- 55% liquid called plasma (yellow in colour)
- 45% cellular componenets

## Three Functions of Blood

1. Transport
2. Temperature regulation
3. Defence against disease

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%208.png)

## Blood is made up of 4 parts

1. Plasma
2. Red Blood Cells
3. White Blood Cells
4. Platelets

### Plasma

- Transport of substances such as glucose, amino acids, vitamins
- Helps keep body at optimum body temperature by transferring heat

### Red Blood Cells (rbc)

- Biconcave Discs
- No nucleus (prokaryote)
- No mitochondria
- Flexible membrane
- Made continuously in red bone marrow of ribs and sternum
- Contain the red coloured iron containing hemoglobin which carry oxygen
- Anaemia - disease where blood lacks enough red blood cells to carry oxygen effciently causing excess tiredness
- Caused by lack of iron in diet, can also be a genetic disorder

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%209.png)

### White Blood Cells (wbc)

- Larger and less of them then red blood cells
- Have a nucleus (eukaryote)
- Protect body against disease

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%2010.png)

**2 Types**

1. Monocytes = Engulf bacteria by phagocytosis

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%2011.png)

1. Lymphocytes = Made in lymphatic system. They form antibodies, which are chemicals used to kill bacteria and viruses (More of these)

### Platelets

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%2012.png)

- Fragments of larger cells formed in bone marrow
- Important role in clotting the blood (scab)

## Blood Grouping Systems

1. ABO system = There are 4 blood groups: A, B, AB and O. O is the universal donor and AB is the universal recipient
2. Rhesus system = Humans are rhesus positive or rhesus negative. If a baby is Rh+ and its mother is Rh-, it can cause complications during pregnancy and childbirth

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%2013.png)

Anti D = injection which removes babys Rh + blood that has entered mothers system

## Double Circulation in Humans

The human circulatory system is a two-circuit system:

- Pulmonary Circuit
    - Heart →Lungs →Heart
- Systemic Circuit
    - Heart → Body → Heart

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%2014.png)

## Portal Systems

A portal system carries blood directly from one organ to another without going through the heart

E.g. Hepatic Portal System

# The Heart ♡

| Question  | Answer                                                                             |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Location  | "Between the lungs, slightly to the left side of the thorax, above the disaphragm" |
| Function  | To pump blood around the body (has its own blood supply through coronary artery)   |
| Structure | "A hollow structure made of cardiac muscle, surrounded by a double membrane"       |

## Role of Heart Muscle

1. The heart wall is made of Cardiac Muscle
2. Contraction of the cardiac muscle drives blood around the body
3. Cardiac Muscle does not fatigue (tire easily) because it has it’s own blood supply (coronary artery)

## Roles of Valves

## Blood supply to the heart wall

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%2020.png)

### Coronary Arteries

Cardiam muscle is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries. These branch from the aorta just above the semi lunar vavles of the aorta

### Coronary Veins

Drain blood from heart wall into the wall atrium

## Pulse

The alternate expansion and contraction of arteries is called a pulse

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%2021.png)

Average pulse rate is 72 beats per minute

## Blood Pressure

Pressure in blood due to the contraction of the ventricles which forces blood into the arteries

Blood pressure is measured with an instrument that records the pressure it takes to stop the blood flow in an artery of the upper arm

![Untitled](The%20Circul%20b5cc7/Untitled%2022.png)

## Effect of Smoking on the Circulation System

(insert picture here)

1. Nicotine increases the heart rate and blood pressure
    
    These puts a bigger workload on the heart
    
2. CO2 reduces the amount of O2 carried bu the blood
    
    This reduces energy levels
    
3. Other chemicals in tobacco
    
    Increase the chance of clots
    

## Effect of Diet on the Circulation System

(insert picture here)

High intake of fat causes a build up of cholesterol

Cholesterol may block arterioles and lead to stroke or heart attack

High salt intake raises blood pressure which can cause a heart attack

## Effect of Exercise on the Circulation System

(insert picture here)

Exercise strenghtens the heart

This improves circulation

Exercise increases our ability to transport oxygen

This gives increased energy levels

# Lymphatic System

A secondary transoirt system consisting of one way system of vessels that collects and return excess tissue fluid to blood system

**Structure:**

1. Lymph Vessels
2. Lymph Nodes
3. Lymph

(insert diagram here)

## Lymph vessles & blood vessels

(insert diagram here)

10% of tissue fluid enters the lymphatic system

## Lymphatic System Functions

1. Collect tissue fluid and return it to the blood system
2. Fight infection by 
    1. Filtering out microorganisms in the lymph nodes
    2. Destroying microorganisms by antibody production
    3. Mature and store lymphocytes
3. Transport digested fat away from intestine

## Heartbeat Control (Need to Know)

1. The location of the SA and AV nodes
2. Distinguish between Systole & Diastole
3. Be aware that cardiac muscle in the heart wall is specialised not to fatigue
4. Be able to describe the sequence of events in the cardiac cycle
5. Explain the role of the SA and AV nodes in systole and diastole

## Factors affecting Heart Rate

Heart rate is increased by

- Exercise
- Stress

Heart rate is decreased by

- Sleep
- Alcohol

## Heart Rate Control

Controlled by the Pacemaker (SA (sino atrial) Node) in the right atrium wall

The SA Node emits an electrical signal

This causes the atria to contract

This signal is picked up by the AV (atrioventricular) node

The AV node sends a signal to the ventricles

Causing the ventricles to contract

(insert diagram here)

## Stages of the Heartbeat

Contraction of heart muscle is called SYSTOLE

Relaxation of heart muscle is called DIASTOLE

1. Blood enters the two atria. All valves are closed
    
    All chambers are relaxed (diastole)
