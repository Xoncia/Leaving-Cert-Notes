## Enterprise

Enterprise involves being innovative and creative, while taking on the personal and financial risk of failure, to achieve one’s goal.

Enterprise is not just about businesses. It happens when a person comes up with something new and tries to make it a success, aware of the downside that it may fail. Examples of enterprise:
- **Personal enterprise:** Taking a course to develop a skill
- **Business enterprise:** Launching new products (e.g. VR glasses)
- **Government enterprise:** Connecting the LUAS lines
- **Social enterprise:** Organising the Colour Dash for cancer support
