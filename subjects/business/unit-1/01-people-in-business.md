## Types of relationships

### Dependent relationship

- Rely on each other
- Requires help from each other
- Stakeholders need each other to survive
- Needs to have a minimum of 2 stakeholders
- Typically, it is one stakeholder providing a service to another
- Example: Carphone Warehouse were forced to close Irish branches when they lost provider contracts

### Symbiotic relationship

- Rely on each other

### Dynamic relationship

- Always moving/changing
- Both Competitive and Co-operative
- Constant chance to change
- Pepsi given the chance at getting Coca-Cola's recipe. Rang Coca-Cola and let them know it was offered
- Example: Employees work together day to day but compete for promotion

### Co-operative relationship

A co-operative relationship exists when stakeholders work together towards a common goal. It is a **win-win** relationship

**Examples:**

- Purchasing manager and supplier
- Suppliers and producers
- Employers and employees
- Service providers and producers
- Customers and producers
- Government and interest groups (Try to avoid because these relationships fluctuate between co-operative and competitive/aggressive)

A purchasing manager may ask for their credit period to be extended when they experience cash flow problems

- If the **supplier** increases the credit period, the supplier **wins**, as they are building customer loyalty for future sales
- The **purchasing manager** also **wins**, as they have time to raise enough cash to pay off their debts and will not face penalties or bankruptcy

### Competitive relationship

A competitive relationship exists when one stakeholder benefits at the other party’s expense. It is a **win–lose** relationship

**e.g. investor and entrepreneur**

- An investor will want a high return on investment
- If they negotiate for a higher return from the entrepreneur, the investor will receive a higher share of profits and higher dividends (will **win**) at the expense of the entrepreneur (will **lose**), who has to give away a higher percentage of their profits from the business
