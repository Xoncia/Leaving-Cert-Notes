### **Public limited company (PLC)**

- Must have minimum of seven shareholders, no upper limit
- Shares sold on a stock exchange
- Stock exchange listing can boost exposure for the brand and can help attract top staff
- Businesses that have grown may seek to float on the stock exchange; this is a very expensive process that requires huge preparation and a forensic look at the company’s finances
- Easier targets for takeover bids from rivals – share price impacts the value of the company, which can be out of the control of the owners (e.g. stock prices fell drastically during the COVID-19 pandemic)

### **Semi-state bodies**

Semi-state bodies are state-owned (government) enterprises that are technically commercially run, which benefits the Irish government (e.g. Dublin Bus, An Post, RTÉ, Bord Gáis)

### **Advantages of state-owned enterprises**

- Increased government revenue (sale)
- Improved efficiency/standard
- More finance to expand/develop
- Increased competition (deregulation)

### **Disadvantages of state-owned enterprises**

- Loss of state assets
- Loss of control over services
- Increased unemployment
- Consumers may face higher prices

## **Semi-state bodies: privatisation/nationalisation**

### **Privatisation**

Privatisation is the selling of a state-owned company to private investors. The sale raises money for the government, but they then lose control over the service.

**Advantages:**

- More efficient
- More access to finance
- May lead to increased competition

**Disadvantages:**

- Loss of control over the service
- May lead to job losses
- Business may reduce services (now profit-driven)

### **Nationalisation**

Nationalisation is when a privately run business is taken over and run by the state. This happens when a business/industry cannot support itself, and the government deems it an essential service for citizens. The government buys to save the business/industry so that services can be maintained.

### Franchises

Franchisor grants a licence for a franchisee to sell its products or use its business idea in return for a fee and a percentage of turnover/profits 

### **Advantages of being a franchisee**

- Use a proven/successful business idea
- Existing customer base, loyalty, data on market
- Benefit from economies of scale (advertising, raw materials)
- Support/training/mentoring offered by franchisor

### **Disadvantages of being a franchisee**

- More expensive: one-off payment of fee, then percentage of sales/profits
- Restricted innovation, limited range of offerings
- Restricted sales territories
- Risk of damage to brand’s reputation by other franchisees

### **Indigenous business**

Irish-owned, locally based business that are established, owned and managed by Irish residents

### **Importance of indigenous firms for Ireland**

- Firms have a high loyalty to Ireland
- Provide local benefits (e.g. purchase raw materials locally)
- Create entrepreneurial role models for young Irish residents
- Reduce our reliance on FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)
- Increase Ireland’s export levels, if the companies sell abroad (improve our balance of payments)
