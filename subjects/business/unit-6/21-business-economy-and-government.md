## Economic Variables

Different economic variables affect the economy, businesses, consumers and the government:

1. Inflation
2. Interest rates
3. Employment
4. Exchange rates
5. Taxation

### 1. Inflation

| | |
|-|-|
| Inflation | Sustained increase in the general level of prices over a period of time |
| Deflation | Decrease in the general level of prices in two consecutive quarters |

#### Potential impact of high inflation rates on the Irish economy

- Purchasing power of money falls over time - saving is discouraged
- More wage demands from workers are likely - there may be strikes and poor morale
- Lower standard of living - less purchasing power, as the cost of living rises
- Exports become less competitive, as Irish selling prices rise in relation to goods from other countries
- Increased government expenditure on wages (e.g. teachers, nurses), as the cost of living rises

**From Teacher**

- Purchase power falls
- Higher wage demands
- Lower standard of living
- Exports the less competitive
- * Increase government expenditure on wages

### 2. Interest Rates

The cost of borrowing money expressed as a percentage of amount borrowed

- Debt capital more costly: higher repayments for individuals and government when borrowing or repaying debt at a variable rate; if a business has borrowed, the higher repayments make it harder to expand
- Harder to attract investors: return for savings in deposit accounts are higher, so savings accounts more offer a more attractive, risk-free return for investors
- Less consumer spending: more expensive to access loans, mortgage repayments are higher, so consumers spend less

**From Teacher**

- Cost of borrowing
- Percentage of amount borrowed
- Debt capital: borrowing to expand
- Fixed rate: Doesn't change
- Variable rate: Matches current rates
- Harder to attract investors
- If they go higher, consumer spending drops

### 3. Employment Levels

Unemployment = Percentage of labour force not currently employed

#### Benefits and challenges of low unemployment levels

**Benefits**

- Government tax revenue increases, government spending on social welfare decreases
- Less emigration and 'brain drain' of highly skilled workers
- Increased spending: incomes are higher

**Challenges**

- Labour shortages in certain areas may cause high wage inflation
- Pressure on rent/property prices in areas of high employment
- Social costs (e.g. commuting workers have less time for community involvement)

**From Teacher**

- Currently 7% unemployment in Ireland
- Low levels (of unemployment) means less people to choose in interviews
- Low levels (of unemployment) lead to higher income tax
- Low levels (of unemployment) lead to higher spending 
- High levels (of unemployment) lead to spending more on social services
- High levels (of unemployment) leads to more emigration

### 4. Exchange Rates

The price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency

**What happens if sterling (£) weakens against the euro (€)?**

Sterling would not buy as much euro as it did before, so sterling has weaker purchasing power in the exchange rate

**This can:**

- Lower demand for Irish goods by UK consumers
- Lower demand for Irish holidays by UK holidaymakers
- Increase demand for UK imports (vs buying domestically)
- Increase demand for UK holidays for Irish people (vs holidaying in Ireland)

**From Teacher**

- Value of currencies against other currencies
- High exchange rate of euros will lower demand for Irish producers and holidays here
- Low rate of exchange for euros will lead to an increase demand for Irish goods and holidays

### 5. Taxation

| | |
|-|-|
| Direct tax | Tax on earnings/income (e.g. PAYE, USC, corporation tax) |
| Indirect tax | Tax on spending and consumption (e.g. VAT, SSDT, excise duties) |

**What are the impacts on Irish business if the government changes tax rates?**

- If corporation tax was increased from 12.5%, businesses would keep less of the profit, so they might need to increase prices or reduce staff
- If there was a reduction in PAYE rates, consumers would have more disposable income, which could lead to an increase in demand for goods
- If import duties were increased/introduced, the businesses importing raw materials or finished goods for resale would face increased costs, which could lead to lower profits or higher prices
- If VAT was decreased, a business could keep more of the profit for each item sold, or reduce their selling price. More competitive prices could stimulate the economy

**From Teachers**

- Direct tax is taken from income/earnings (PAYE, PRSI, USC)
- Indirect taxation is taken from spending and consumption (VAT, excise duties)
- Corporation tax: If it is increased Ireland will lose corporations to other countries
- A reduction in PAYE will increase the amount of income workers receive
- Impact duties: If lowered, imports are cheaper
- If VAT decreases, products are cheaper

## How the government creates a climate for business

| | |
|-|-|
| Government expenditure | Increase or decrease capital: one-off expenditure (e.g. build a school) and current/day-to-day expenditure (e.g. wages) |
| Government agencies | Enterprise Ireland, Industrial Development Agency, LEOs |
| Government taxation | Can change tax rates to encourage or discourage certain behaviours; can introduce new taxes (e.g. SSDT) |
| Government grants | Issue financial grants to aid expansion in certain industries or lines of work through LEOs, Enterprise Ireland and IDA |
| Government regulations | Adjust or introduce new laws (e.g. environmental, data protection) |
