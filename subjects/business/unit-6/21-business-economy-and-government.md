Different economic variables affect the economy, businesses, consumers and the government:

1. Inflation
2. Interest rates
3. Employment
4. Exchange rates
5. Taxation

### 1. Inflation

| | |
|-|-|
| Inflation | Sustained increase in the general level of prices over a period of time |
| Deflation | Decrease in the general level of prices in two consecutive quarters |

#### Potential impact of high inflation rates on the Irish economy

- 

**From Teacher**

- Purchase power falls
- Higher wage demands
- Lower standard of living

- 

**From Teacher**

- Cost of borrowing
- Percentage of amount borrowed
- Debt capital: borrowing to expand
- Fixed rate: Doesn't change
- Variable rate: Matches current rates
- Harder to attract investors
- If they go higher, consumer spending drops

### 3. Employment Levels

Unemployment = Percentage of labour force not currently employed

#### Benefits and challenges of low unemployment levels

**Benefits**

- _

**Challenges**

- _

**From Teacher**

- Currently 7% unemployment in Ireland
- Low levels (of unemployment) means less people to choose in interviews
- Low levels (of unemployment) lead to higher income tax
- Low levels (of unemployment) lead to higher spending 
- High levels (of unemployment) lead to spending more on social services
- High levels (of unemployment) leads to more emigration

### 4. Exchange Rates

The price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency

**What happens if sterling (£) weakens against the euro (€)?**

Sterling would not buy as much euro as it did before, so sterling has weaker purchasing power in the exchange rate

**This can:**

- 

**From Teacher**

- Value of currencies against other currencies
- High exchange rate of euros will lower demand for Irish producers and holidays here
- Low rate of exchange for euros will lead to an increase demand for Irish goods and holidays

### 5. Taxation

| | |
|-|-|
| Direct tax | Tax on earnings/income (e.g. PAYE, USC, corporation tax) |
| Indirect tax | Tax on spending and consumption (e.g. VAT, SSDT, excise duties) |

**What are the impacts on Irish business if the government changes tax rates?**

- 

**From Teachers**

- Direct tax is taken from income/earnings (PAYE, PRSI, USC)
- Indirect taxation is taken from spending and consumption (VAT, excise duties)
- Corporation tax: If it is increased Ireland will lose corporations to other countries
- A reduction in PAYE will increase the amount of income workers receive
- Impact duties: If lowered, imports are cheaper
- If VAT decreases, products are cheaper
