## Types of Production
(From Teacher)

| Term             | Definition                                                                                                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Job Production   | 1 off, unique protection of a 'product' usually called bespoke e.g art, wedding dress, unique/custom jewellery |
| Batch Production | Usually produce products in multiples e.g 10's. 100's, 1000's. Produced by colour or size                      |
| Mass Production  | All products are made on an assembly line. Continuous production                                               |

## Production Options 
(From Slides)

| Type | Explanation | Features of Process |
|-|-|-|
| Job         | Specific product made to meet a consumer’s needs, e.g. a wedding dress              | Specialised/expensive labour, flexible machinery, premium price, slow process       |
| Batch       | Production of a limited quantity of identical products, e.g. a batch of Maths books | One batch at a time (same size, shape, colour), semi-skilled labour, made for stock |
| Mass (flow) | Continuous production of the same item, e.g. toilet paper, biros                    | Items used up regularly, lower labour needs, highly automated, made for stock       |

## Features of Types of Production

### Job Production

- Products are unique, so they vary from customer to customer
- Labour intensive, requiring skilled or specialised staff, increasing wage costs
- Requires flexible machinery that can be adapted for each design
- Might be hard to buy raw materials in bulk, as different orders require different raw materials (increases cost per unit)
- Sold at a premium price, as products are of a higher standard
- It is a slower process, so fewer orders can be made compared with batch or mass production

### Batch Production

- Employees are usually semi-skilled but generally less skilled than for job production, which lowers production costs per unit
- Quicker production process than job production, as goods can be made for stock, not just when an order is made by a customer
- Machines can perform various jobs and sizes to suit different batches

### Mass Production

- A high degree of automation is involved, so a large capital investments required
- Labour needs are lower and tend to be less skilled, for example, factory line workers with few tasks; this can lead to worker boredom
- Materials can be purchased in bulk, so goods can be made for a much lower cost per unit

## Impacts of Changing from Job to Mass or Batch

- Investment required
- Loss of USP
- Effective stock control
- Reduced prices
- Lower profit margin

## Impact of Moving from Batch/Mass to Job

- Fewer options for customers
- USP can be developed
- Capital investment required
- Impacts staff
- Training required
- Less diversified business
- Brand image impacted

## Break-Even Analysis

| Name                    | Definition                                                                            | Formula/Example                                |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed Costs             | Costs that remain the same irrespective of the level of output                        | Rent, loan repayments                          |
| Variable Costs          | Costs that change as the level of output changes                                      | Direct wages                                   |
| Contribution per Unit   | How much each unit sold will make after deducting the cost of manufacturing           | Selling price - variable cost per unit         |
| Break-Even Amount       | The number of units a business needs to sell to cover total costs                     | Fixed costs ÷ contribution per unit            |
| Profit at Full Capacity | How much profit the business plans to make if it successfully sells the target output | Total revenue - total costs                    |
| Total Revenue           | The sum raised from selling goods                                                     | Selling price x output                         |
| Total Costs             | The sum of all the costs of production                                                | Fixed costs + variable costs                   |
| Margin of Safety        | How far forecasted sales can fall before the business becomes lossmaking              | Forecast output - break-even amount (in units) |
## Steps in drawing a break-even chart

1. Draw and label the axes 
2. Add lines for total revenue, total cost, fixed cost
3. Show the break-even point, break-even revenue/cost and break-even units
4. Highlight the margin of safety and profit at full capacity

## Benefits and limitations of break-even analysis

Benefits: 

- Shows forecasted profits at different sales levels
- Shows the size of the safety net if sales don’t meet targets (margin of safety)

Limitations: 

- Prices may have to be lowered to sell more units, as it will help increase the demand, and the break-even analysis shows the projections based on the selling price remaining consistent
- Variable costs might decrease when buying in bulk so won’t be constant over all quantities. A break-even analysis is based on variable costs remaining the same at all levels of output
- Does not factor in any sales that are returned by consumers (e.g. faulty goods)
