### Stage 1: Idea generation

- Brainstorming is used to throw around ideas and come up with options. It is a great way to spark new ideas in a group.
- Market research is used to find out what consumers want through surveys or observation.
- Good idea generation allows the business to have many varied ideas to choose from, maybe identifying new areas of types of products instead of getting stuck in the same pattern.

### Stage 2: Product screening (ideas)

- Ideas are analysed and the weaker ones are discarded following a **SWOT** analysis **(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats)**
- Ideas that have potential are explored. The business identifies products worth developing by comparing to similar products on the market
- Ideas with no future potential can be discarded.

### Stage 3: Concept development

- The basic idea is now converted into a product concept that is capable of satisfying consumers. Design, layout, function and features are developed to evolve beyond the basic idea.
- The product’s USP (Unique Selling Point) is established.
- The business establishes the main differentiating factor that will make the new product stand out against current competitors in the market.

### Stage 4: Feasibility study

- Can it be done?
- **Financial feasibility:** A break-even analysis can be carried out to see how many units would need to be sold to cover costs.
- **Production feasibility:** Is it technically possible to produce?
- **Commercial feasibility:** Is the market large enough for the business to make a profit? (Conduct research to establish market size.)

## Stage 5: Prototype development

- An original working model of the product is produced.
- The working model makes it possible to identify possible production difficulties.
- Calculations are made on the raw materials and labour needed to produce the product.
- Additional prototypes can be improved by development and testing until the product is ready to proceed.

## Stage 6: Test marketing

- Release the product on a small scale initially (supply the product to a small group of the target market).
- Take feedback into account and make modifications, as necessary.
- If feedback is strongly negative, shelve the idea. Develop new ideas.

## Stage 7: Product launch

- The business can now set up production facilities – or outsource the production. 
- The business gets media coverage and may hold a press conference.
- Social media is used to gain publicity for the launch and for the new product.
