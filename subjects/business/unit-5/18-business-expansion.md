## Types of expansion: benefits and risks

| Type | Benefits | Risks |
|-|-|-|
| Franchising | Low capital investment; fast; franchisor motivated/invested; economies of scale | Loss of control; reputational risk for brand; cost/time of training and supervision |
| Takeover | Economies of scale; access to new markets and products; eliminate a rival | Capital required; hostile, may cause unrest; high risk of failure |
| Merger | Diversification; allows rapid expansion; lowers operating costs; new markets | Clash of cultures may exist; industrial relations issues over redundancies and roles |
| Strategic alliance | Cost-effective; easier to end; provides access to new markets and resources | Unequal input from parties; trade secrets/ advantages may be lost; change needs to be managed well, as alliances are short-term |

## Capital for expansion: equity or debt capital?

| | | |
|-|-|-|
| **Burden of repayments** | **Equity:** No repayments, no loss of assets, less pressure on cash flow | **Debt:** Large repayments with interest, loss of assets |
| **Timing of repayments** | **Equity:** Business can choose when to pay dividends to shareholders | **Debt:** Repayments must be made regularly, no flexibility |
| **Level of security** | **Equity:** No security needed, no risk of losing use of an asset | **Debt:** Usually needs security/collateral |
| **Level of control** | **Equity:** Loss of control from owners to new shareholders in decision-making | **Debt:** No voting power given to the lender |
| **Tax effect** | **Equity:** Dividends are not tax-deductible for a business | **Debt:** Interest on loans for repayments are tax-deductible |

## Impact of expansion on a business

| | Short-term impact | Long-term impact |
|-|-|-|
| **Organisational structure** | May need formal structure as it grows (e.g. functional structure) | May split as it further expands (e.g. geographic or product structure) |
| **Product mix** | Increased mix, selling off assets that do not fit the new company | Expansion into new markets (merger/takeover), wider product range |
| **Profitability** | Costly â€“ restructuring of business, rebranding, redundancies, takeover | Economies of scale, increased sales |
| **Employment** | Redundancies/rationalisation, fear/uncertainty/low morale | More job security, more opportunities/promotions |
