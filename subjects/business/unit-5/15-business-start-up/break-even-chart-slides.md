# Break-Even Chart Slides

[Slides](slides/break-even-chart-slides.pdf)

A Business supplies the following figures about its activities:

- Fixed Costs: €300,000
- Variable Cost: €20 per unit
- Forecast output (Sales): €20,000 units
- Selling Price: €50 per unit

Illustrate by means of a break-even chart (40 marks):

- The break-even point
- The profit at full capacity
- The margin of safety

## Answer

Units 20,000

Fixed Costs: €300,000

Variable Costs (20,000 x €20) = €400,000

Totals Costs: €300,000 + €400,000 = €700,000

Total Revenue: (20,000 x €50) = €1,000,000

Profit = €1,000,000 - €700,000 = €300,000

Break-even formula:

$$
\frac{Fixed Costs}{Selling Price (SP) per unit - Variable Cost (VC) per unit}
$$

$$
= \frac{300,000}{50 -20}
$$

= 100,000 units

Drawing the Break-Even Chart

To plot break-even point on chart

From X axis 10,000

From Y axis €500,000 (10,000 x €50)

## Example Question

Read the information supplied and answer the questions which follow

Medron plc has supplied the following financial information for the new medical device:

Forecast Output (Sales): 60,000 units

Selling Price per unit: €30

Fixed Costs: €400,000

Variable Costs per unit: €20

Illustrate the following by means of a break-even chart (25 marks)

1. Break-even point
2. Margin of safety at the forecast output
3. Profit at forecast output

### Answer (to Example Question)

1. BEP = Fixed Costs/Contribution = 400,000/30-20 = 40,000 units
2. Margin of Safety = 60,000 - 40,000 = 20,000 units
3. Profit at Forecast Output = 1,800,000 - 1,600,000 = €200,000

If you only did the calculations, you would get only get 12 total marks for the question. 4 marks for the BEP calculation, 4 marks for the MOS and 4 marks for the Profit at Forecast Output

#### Table

| Units  | Selling Price | Variable Costs | Fixed Costs | Total Costs | Total Revenue | Profit/Loss |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 0      | 30            | 20             | 400,000     | 400,000     | 0             | (400,000)   |
| 40,000 | 30            | 20             | 400,000     | 1,200,000   | 1,200,000     | 0           |
| 60,000 | 30            | 20             | 400,000     | 1,600,000   | 1,800,000     | 200,000     |
