## Gross Profit Margin (GPM) – profitability ratio

| | |
|-|-|
| Explanation | Percentage of sales a business keeps after deducting cost of sales |
| Formula | ![GPM Formula](12-monitoring-a-business-ratio-analysis/gpm-formula.png) |
| How to improve | Increase sales (advertising campaign). Reduce direct costs |
| Interested stakeholders | Employees (job security). Investor (measure against competitors). Manager (assess performance, earn bonuses) |

## Net Profit Margin (NPM) - profitability ratio

| | |
|-|-|
| Explanation | Percentage of sales a business keeps after deducting all expenses |
| Formula | ![NPM Formula](12-monitoring-a-business-ratio-analysis/npm-formula.png) |
| How to improve | Increase sales (promotional campaign). Reduce expenses (change service provider) |
| Interested stakeholders | Employees (job security). Investor (measure against competitors) |

## Return on Investment (ROI) – profitability ratio

| | |

| Interested stakeholders | Investors (shows their expected return). Employees (with shares) |

## Current ratio - liquidity ratio

(Slide is blank for some reason, not sure what goes here)

## Acid test ratio – liquidity ratio

| | |
|-|-|
| Explanation | Compares value of current assets owned by the business with how much it owes in the short term. Removes closing stock from current ratio, as it can be slow to sell
| Formula | (Current assets – Closing stock): Current liabilities = X:1 (ideal = 1:1) |
| How to improve | Sell slow-moving stock at a discount |
| Interested stakeholders | Employees (shows if there is enough cash to pay staff on time). Suppliers (shows the risk of the business becoming a bad debt) |

<!--card-->

## Debt/Equity ratio – gearing ratio

| | |
|-|-|
| Explanation | Compares long-term funding of the business – % debt to % equity funding |
| Formula | Debt capital : Equity capital = X:1 |
| How to improve | <1:1 low geared; 1:1 neutral gearing; >1:1 highly geared |
| Interested stakeholders | Shareholders (high debt means high interest/repayments) |

## Limitations of ratio analysis

| | |
|-|-|
| Changes to staffing | The business may have lost key personnel over the year. The business might not be as strong going into the next year, but this would not be shown in the figures |
| Valuation of assets | Assets may be under- or over-valued in order to affect ratios favourably for the business. This may not give a clear and fair representation of the current situation |
| Changes in business environment | Predicting the future based on past performance does not factor in changes to the business environment |
| Other economic variables | Ratios do not factor in changes in inflation rates. The prices at which the business buys stock could have increased. Sales revenue could have risen without the business actually selling more, if the business increased its prices |
