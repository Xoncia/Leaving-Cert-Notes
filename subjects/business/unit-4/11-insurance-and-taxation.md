## Principles of insurance

| | |
|-|-|
| Utmost good faith | Must disclose all material facts when applying for insurance |
| Insurable interest | The insured must gain from an item’s existence or suffer financially from its loss |
| Indemnity| A person cannot profit from insurance |
| Subrogation | Rights to recover losses transfer to insurance company after the insured is fully compensated by them |
| Contribution | If more than one insurance company is required, any pay-out is proportionally divided  |

## Factors that affect the size of your insurance premium

| Level of risk faced | The higher the probability of the insurance company having to pay a claim, the higher the premium. A loading is added to a premium for a higher risk (e.g. driver’s penalty points). A deduction makes a premium cheaper (e.g. no claims bonus). |
|-|-|
| Value of the item | The higher the value of the item and the potential pay-out, the higher the premium. |
| Number of claims made | If the insurance company sees an increase in the number of pay-outs for a particular type of claim, the costs of premiums will rise to offset this. |
| Profit level required by insurance company | Many insurance companies are public limited companies, so their main objective is to achieve a certain level of profit to satisfy their shareholders. |
| Government levies | If a levy (an extra charge) is applied to an insurance type, it will be applied to relevant premiums, increasing the price. |

## Risk Management

- A planned approach to handling the risks facing a business, by identifying all the possible risks it faces, then taking measures to reduce some risks. 
- **Effective methods:**
  - Take out insurance for the risk.
  - Introduce or improve safety procedures.
  - Carry out safety audits (internal/external).
  - Upskill/train staff in safety.
  - Install CCTV, fire doors and an alarm system.
