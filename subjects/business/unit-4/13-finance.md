## Benefits of a cash flow forecast for a business

| | |
|-|-|
| Improve financial control | Take corrective action in advance of a problem |
| Access finance | Apply for loans, show ability to repay, attract investors |
| Highlight cash deficits | Predict cash shortages to adjust spending or arrange finance |
| Highlight cash surpluses | Predict cash surpluses to plan saving or spending |

| Adjust receipts | Change marketing mix (e.g. new advertising campaign) |
| Adjust payments | Postpone, reduce, delay or spread any planned payments |
| Seek advice | Household (credit union/bank), business (accountant/advisor) |

## Short-term finance

Finance available for a period of up to one year, repaid with 12 months and used for working capital needs

Uses: Paying bill (phone, electricity, gas), wages, buying stock

| | |
|-|-|
| Back Overdraft * | Negotiate a limit below zero in your current account |
| Accrued expenses | Delay paying bills for a period to free money for other uses |
| Credit card * | Pay now, get a bill later (high interest if unpaid) |
| Trade credit * | Receive goods now, pay supplier later (typically 30 days) |
| Factoring of debts | Sell your debtors to a debt collector for an upfront payment |

```*``` = Most commonly used

## Medium-term finance

Finance available for a period of between on and five years

Uses: Machinery, computers, delivery vehicles with a life span of over oney year and under five years

| | |
|-|-|
| Lease | Rent an asset (never owning it) so no initial payment is needed |
| Hire purchase | Buy an asset over time, ownership only transfers after final payment is made |
| Medium-term loan | Take a loan for between one and five years; repay in regular, equal installments that include interest |

## Long-term finance

Finance available to fund the long-term running of the business or household (over five years)

Uses: Fund long-term expansion/growth (new store, warehouse, long-term machinery)

| | |
|-|-|
| Reserves | Profits left over from trading are reinvested; retained earnings |
| Government grant | Money provided to a business for a purpose; doesn't have to be repaid |
| Long-term loan debenture | Repayable in regular monthly installments plus interest to a bank; interest repaid regularly, and initial principle repaid at the end |
| Share capital | Share capital raised by selling shares to investors (shareholders) |

## Factors when choosing between different sources of finance

| | |
|-|-|
| Cost | Compare expense measured by APR, extra fees/charges |
| Purpose | Match source to use (e.g. overdraft for short-term use, such as paying bills) |
| Amount | Reserves maybe be limited in size: a long-term loan may be needed |
| Control | <u>Equity captial</u> (Sale of shares for money (investment)) gives voting rights away: could lose control of an important asset which is used as collateral |
| Collateral | Assets may be required to access a loan (assets used as security) |

## What affects the ability to qualify for a loan?

| | |
|-|-|
| Collateral | Value of the security available that can be repossessed if loan cannot be repaid |
| Capacity | Ability to repay: cash flow forecast (business), budget (household) |
| Character | Creditworthiness, reputation, credit rating (trustworthiness of borrower) |
| Purpose | Size of loan will increase risk; will purpose actually increase revenue? |

## Business versus household finances

| Similarities | Differences |
|-|-|
| Both need to plan for the future to help control their finances: cash flow forecast (business), budget (household) | Businesses have access to more sources of finance (e.g. debentures, trade credit) |
| Both need to keep accurate records and file important documents; this helps when applying for a bank loan | Businesses usually deal with much greater amounts of money (e.g. debentures) |
| Both need to match the purpose of the finance to the length of the finance (e.g. bank overdraft for short-term needs) | Businesses need to include additional expenditure (e.g. VAT and PRSI, which they collect and give to Revenue) |
