## Benefits of good industrial relations

1. Improved employee motivation (Reason for this: Employees work harder when they enjoy work)
2. Lower absenteeism (Absenteeism: People calling in sick or taking sick days)
3. Increased productivity (Reason for this: People work more efficiently when they are happy)
4. Higher retention rates (Less people quit)

## Factors leading to industrial disputes

**In order of most frequent to least frequent**

1. Disputes over pay
2. Redundancy (When your job no longer exists)
3. Disputes over working conditions
4. Unfair dismissal
5. Discrimination
6. New technology
7. Demarcation issues
8. Trade union recognition

## Types of pay claims employees can make

**Cost of living claim:**

- High prices caused by inflation have made it difficult for a person to maintain their standard of living

**Comparability claim:**

- Employees compare larger salaries of similar jobs in different sectors

**Productivity claim:**

- Additional pay for employees with increased output/productivity

**Relativity claim:**

- Linked professions – if one receives a pay increase, the other might also seek an increase (e.g. Gardaí and nurses)

## Trade unions

**Trade Union:**

From Slides:

- An organisation formed to protect the rights and interests of the members it represents, usually employees in a particular industry
- Can be an important source of information for employees
- Can provide employees with protection on employment matters
- Can negotiate with the employer for better pay and conditions

From Class:

- Can provide assistance in legal disputes
- Can represent members
- Can protect members from unfair practise
- Can negotiate on behalf of members
- Provide info to members

**Shop Steward:**

- An elected union representative and the contact point if a member has any concern in a workplace

[Non-legislative Solutions (Non-legal, no laws govern these methods)](3%20Industri%2046f20/Non-legisl%20a992f.csv)

[Industrial Relations Act 1990](3%20Industri%2046f20/Industrial%20b3b3c.csv)

## Industrial Relations Act 1990

- Employer cannot sue for business disruption
- Outlines around for official disputes or strike action
- Lawfully protest without reprisal
- Covers all legal activities around employment
- Have to give 7 days notice to strike (gives chance to employer to resolve conflict)
- A confidential secret ballot must be carried out before a strike can happen

[Picketing Terms](3%20Industri%2046f20/Picketing%20%20b1a3c.csv)

## Types of industrial action

The industrial actions above are legal. Workers are not allowed to engage in a wildcat or lightning strike (an unofficial strike where no notice is given to the employer)

While citizens can legally protest the government, it is illegal for workers to stop work in order to protest a government decision

### Impact of industrial action on stakeholders

**Employees:**

- No wage

**Customers:**

- May shop elsewhere
- No good to buy

**Investors:**

- Productivity paused

- Share price falls
- Money being used to cover strike

**Employer:**

- Time wasted
- Loses money
- Morale falls
- Strains relationships

**Supplier:**

- No orders

Employees can't take industrial action over management decisions made for the business
