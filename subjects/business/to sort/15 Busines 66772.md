## Features of Types of Production

### Job Production

- Products are unique, so they vary from customer to customer
- Labour intensive, requiring skilled or specialised staff, increasing wage costs
- Requires flexible machinery that can be adapted for each design
- Might be hard to buy raw materials in bulk, as different orders require different raw materials (increases cost per unit)
- Sold at a premium price, as products are of a higher standard
- It is a slower process, so fewer orders can be made compared with batch or mass production

### Batch Production

- Employees are usually semi-skilled but generally less skilled than for job production, which lowers production costs per unit
- Quicker production process than job production, as goods can be made for stock, not just when an order is made by a customer
- Machines can perform various jobs and sizes to suit different batches

### Mass Production

- A high degree of automation is involved, so a large capital investments required
- Labour needs are lower and tend to be less skilled, for example, factory line workers with few tasks; this can lead to worker boredom
- Materials can be purchased in bulk, so goods can be made for a much lower cost per unit

## Impacts of Changing from Job to Mass or Batch

- Investment required
- Loss of USP
- Effective stock control
- Reduced prices
- Lower profit margin

## Impact of Moving from Batch/Mass to Job

- Fewer options for customers
- USP can be developed
- Capital investment required
- Impacts staff
- Training required
- Less diversified business
- Brand image impacted

[Break-Even Analysis](15%20Busines%2066772/Break-Even%20447bc.csv)

## Steps in drawing a break-even chart

1. Draw and label the axes 
2. Add lines for total revenue, total cost, fixed cost
3. Show the break-even point, break-even revenue/cost and break-even units
4. Highlight the margin of safety and profit at full capacity

## Benefits and limitations of break-even analysis

Benefits: 

- Shows forecasted profits at different sales levels
- Shows the size of the safety net if sales don’t meet targets (margin of safety)

Limitations: 

- Prices may have to be lowered to sell more units, as it will help increase the demand, and the break-even analysis shows the projections based on the selling price remaining consistent
- Variable costs might decrease when buying in bulk so won’t be constant over all quantities. A break-even analysis is based on variable costs remaining the same at all levels of output
- Does not factor in any sales that are returned by consumers (e.g. faulty goods)
