Forecast Output = 50,000

Fixed Costs = €160,000

Selling Price = €20

Variable Cost = €12

---

Selling Price - Variable Cost = Contribution

20 - 12 = 8

Contribution = €8

---

20 x 5,000 = 100,000

12 x 5,000 = 60,000 + 160,000 = 220,000

Break-even point (BEP) = €400,000

                                          20,000

BEP is the point where Total Revenue and Total Cost meets

### Margin of Safety

1. 50,000 x €20 = €1,000,000
2. 50,000 x €12 = €600,000 + €160,000 = €760,000
3. €1,000,000 - €760,000 = €240,000
