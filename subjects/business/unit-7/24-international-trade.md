## Open economy

A country that engages in international trade, exporting (selling) goods and services to other countries and importing (buying in) goods and services from other countries

## Terms in international trade

| | |
|-|-|
| Trading bloc | Group of countries that allow free trade among them |
| Free trade area | Members trade freely with reduced/no tariffs or barriers  |
| Customs union | Members trade freely and impose common tariffs on non-members  |
| Deregulation | Reduction or elimination of legal barriers that prevent entry into a market |

<!--card-->

## Elements of trade

| | |
|-|-|
| Visible exports | Purchase of Irish goods by a foreigner |
| Invisible exports | Purchase of an Irish service by a foreigner |
| Visible imports | Purchase of foreign goods by someone in Ireland |
| Invisible imports | Purchase of a foreign service by someone in Ireland |

<!--card-->

## Balance of trade

The difference between visible exports and visible imports

Visible exports > Visible imports = Balance of trade **surplus**

Visible exports < Visible imports = Balance of trade **deficit**

<!--card-->

## Balance of payments

The difference between total exports (visible exports + invisible exports) and total imports (visible imports + invisible imports)

Total exports > Total imports = Balance of payments **surplus**

Total exports < Total imports = Balance of payments **deficit**

<!--card-->

## Protectionism

Actions taken by a government to protect their home industries by restricting foreign competition, using barriers to trade

| Barrier | Explanation |
|-|-|
| Tariff | Tax on an import to raise the price and discourage consumption |
| Embargo | A total ban on importing a certain type of product from a given country |
| Quota | A physical limit on the number of units of a certain good that can be imported |
| Subsidies | Grants/payments from a government to a producer to lower operating costs  |
| Administrative regulations | Slow down imported goods (e.g. customs delays, excessive paperwork for imports) |

<!--card-->

## Impact on Irish businesses of changing trends in international trade

| Trend | Explanation |
|-|-|
| Currency fluctuations | Weaker currencies in trade partners can lower demand for goods |
| MNCs locating in Ireland | Ireland’s skilled workforce and low corporation tax (12.5%) has attracted many large MNCs (e.g. Facebook, Google, Pfizer) |
| Protectionism | Brexit may lead to customs checks, import duties and administrative delays |
| Emerging markets | China, India, Brazil, Russia and Turkey are transitioning from being developing economies to becoming developed economies |
| Newer EU member states | Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia economies are growing, with lower wages and costs than those of Irish businesses |

## Opportunities and challenges for Irish business trading with non-EU countries 

**Opportunities**

- Improvements in technology/ICT
- Emerging markets to export to
- Diversification in new markets reduces overall risk
- Ireland’s image as a ‘green’ country 

**Challenges**

- Globalisation allows lower-cost countries to compete
- Currency/exchange rate fluctuations (e.g. could make Irish exports more expensive)
- Language and cultural differences need to be considered when adapting goods/services
