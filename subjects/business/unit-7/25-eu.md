## The decision-making process of the EU

1. The European Commission is the executive body of the EU. It is the body responsible for drafting and proposing legislation 
2. The European Parliament discusses proposals and puts forward amendments to legislation
3. The Council of the European Union is the main decision-making body of the EU. If they agree to the proposal, there is co-decision with the European Parliament
4. Once legislation is passed by the Council of the European Union and Parliament, it is the Commission's responsibility to implement it using regulations, directives and decisions

## Different types of rules the EU can make

| 1 | 2 |
|-|-|
| EU directive | Allows each member state to decide on how to achieve a particular result that the EU requires member states to reach within a certain time limit |
| EU regulation | Becomes enforceable immediately as law in its entirety in all member states simultaneously |
| EU decision | A legal instrument the EU can use that is binding upon specific people or countries |

## Special interest groups in the EU
Special interest groups play a role in the EU decision-making process, particularly during the consultation stage

Most are based in Brussels/Strasbourg. They lobby, protest and use information campaigns to promote the views of their members (e.g. Irish Farmers' Association)
