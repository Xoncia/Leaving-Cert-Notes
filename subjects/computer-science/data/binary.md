## Digital Data Measurements

| Unit            | How big is it?        |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| 1 bit           | One binary unit (1/0) |
| 1 nibble        | 4 bits                |
| 1 byte          | 8 bits                |
| 1 kilobyte (KB) | 1024 bytes (2^10)     |
| 1 megabyte (MB) | 1024 kilobytes (2^20) |
| 1 gigabyte (GB) | 1024 megabytes (2^30) |
| 1 terabyte (TB) | 1024 gigabytes (2^40) |
| 1 petabyte (PB) | 1024 terabytes (2^50) |
