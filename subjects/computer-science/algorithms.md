# Algorithms

An algorithm in computer science is:

- <u>Finite</u> sequence of <u>well defined (clear) instructions</u>
- Used to <u>solve a problem</u> or perform a computation
- In data processing

## What makes a good algorithm

- Finite
- Well-defined inputs
- Well-defined outputs
- Feasible
- Language independent
- Instructions are unambiguous

## Advantages of Algorithms

- Algorithm not biased
- Faster + cheaper

## Disadvantages of Algorithms

- Algorithms can be badly designed
- Removes the human component
