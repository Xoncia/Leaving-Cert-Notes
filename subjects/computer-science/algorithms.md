- <u>Finite</u> sequence of <u>well definied (clear) instructions</u>
- Used to <u>solve a problem</u> or perform a computation
- In data processing

## What makes a good algorithm

- Finite
- Well-defined inputs
- Well-defined outputs
- Feasible
- Language independent
- Instructions are unambiguous
