# Control and Violence in Room

## Ma

Ma is being held against her will and is subjected to physical sexual and psychological abuse at the hands of old nick

Ma as the mother of jack controls what jack knows she occupies his time with activities and is his main source of information about the world in which they live

Ma and Jack clash sometimes and ma says “I decide for us both”

Ma slowly begins to loosen her control over jack when his safety is threatened because he is getting older and will become a threat to old nick she tells him about the outside world

## Jack

Jack passively controls Ma, he needs her to provide for him, he is still breastfeeding and often tries to feed when she doesn’t want to, she usually gives in, while they are in Room, when they escape she refuses more often. Ma sometimes cannot keep up to with Jack’s demands and trying to entertain him along with the circumstances they are in and so she has “off days”

### Key Moments

- Jacks asks to feed and even tries to lift Ma’s top, she has to push his hand away. At the police station Jack wants to feed, Ma tells him no but when he tries again she allows Jack to feed
