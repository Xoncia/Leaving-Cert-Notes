# The Uncle Speaks in the Drawing Room

> I have seen the mob of late  
> Standing sullen in the square,  
> Gazing with a sullen stare  
> At window, balcony and gate.  
> Some have talked in bitter tones,  
> Some have held and fingered stones.  

> These are follies that subside.  
> Let us consider, none the less,  
> Certain frailties of glass  
> Which, it cannot be denied,  
> Lead in times like these to fear  
> For crystal vase and chandelier.  

> Not that the missiles will be cast;  
> None as yet dare lift an arm.  
> But the scene recalls a storm  
> When our grandsire stood aghast  
> To see his antique ruby bowl  
> Shivered in a thunder-roll.  

> Let us only bear in mind  
> How these treasures handed down  
> From a calmer age passed on  
> Are in the keeping of our kind.  
> We stand between the dead glass-blowers  
> And murmurings of missile throwers.
