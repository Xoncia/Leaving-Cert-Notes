# Our Whole Life

> Our whole life a translation  
> the permissible fibs  

> and now a knot of lies  
> eating at itself to get undone  

> Words bitten thru words  

> meanings burnt-off like paint  
> under the blowtorch  

> All those dead letters  
> rendered into the oppressor's language  

> Trying to tell the doctor where it hurts  

> like the Algerian  
> who has walked from his village, burning  

> his whole body a cloud of pain  
> and there are no words for this  

> except himself
