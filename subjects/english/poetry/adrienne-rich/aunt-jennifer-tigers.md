# Aunt Jennifer's Tigers

> Aunt Jennifer's tigers prance across a screen,  
> Bright topaz denizens of a world of green.  
> They do not fear the men beneath the tree;  
> They pace in sleek chivalric certainty.  

> Aunt Jennifer's finger fluttering through her wool  
> Find even the ivory needle hard to pull.  
> The massive weight of Uncle's wedding band  
> Sits heavily upon Aunt Jennifer's hand.  

> When Aunt is dead, her terrified hands will lie  
> Still ringed with ordeals she was mastered by.  
> The tigers in the panel that she made  
> Will go on prancing, proud and unafraid.
