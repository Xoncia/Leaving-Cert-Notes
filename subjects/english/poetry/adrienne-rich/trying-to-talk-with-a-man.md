# Trying to Talk with a Man

> Out in this desert we are testing bombs,

> that’s why we came here.

> Sometimes I feel an underground river
> forcing its way between deformed cliffs
> an acute angle of understanding
> moving itself like a locus of the sun
> into this condemned scenery.

> What we’ve had to give up to get here –
> whole LP collections, films we starred in
> playing in the neighbourhoods, bakery windows
> full of dry, chocolate-filled Jewish cookies,
> the language of love-letters, of suicide notes,
> afternoons on the riverbank
> pretending to be children

> Coming out to this desert
> we meant to change the face of
> driving among dull green succulents
> walking at noon in the ghost town
> surrounded by a silence

> that sounds like the silence of the place
> except that it came with us
> and is familiar
> and everything we were saying until now
> was an effort to blot it out –
> coming out here we are up against it

> Out here I feel more helpless
> with you than without you
> You mention the danger
> and list the equipment
> we talk of people caring for each other
> in emergencies – laceration, thirst –
> but you look at me like an emergency

> Your dry heat feels like power
> your eyes are stars of a different magnitude
> they reflect lights that spell out: EXIT
> when you get up and pace the floor

> talking of the danger
> as if it were not ourselves
> as if we were testing anything else.
