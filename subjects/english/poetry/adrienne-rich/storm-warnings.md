# Storm Warnings

> The glass has been falling all the afternoon,
> And knowing better than the instrument
> What winds are walking overhead, what zone
> Of grey unrest is moving across the land,
> I leave the book upon a pillowed chair
> And walk from window to closed window, watching
> Boughs strain against the sky

> And think again, as often when the air
> Moves inward toward a silent core of waiting,
> How with a single purpose time has traveled
> By secret currents of the undiscerned
> Into this polar realm. Weather abroad
> And weather in the heart alike come on
> Regardless of prediction.

> Between foreseeing and averting change
> Lies all the mastery of elements
> Which clocks and weatherglasses cannot alter.
> Time in the hand is not control of time,
> Nor shattered fragments of an instrument
> A proof against the wind; the wind will rise,
> We can only close the shutters.

> I draw the curtains as the sky goes black
> And set a match to candles sheathed in glass
> Against the keyhole draught, the insistent whine
> Of weather through the unsealed aperture.
> This is our sole defense against the season;
> These are the things we have learned to do
> Who live in troubled regions.
