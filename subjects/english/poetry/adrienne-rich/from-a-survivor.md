# From a Survivor

> The pact that we made was the ordinary pact  
> of men and women in those days  

> I don't know who we thought we were  
> that our personalities  
> could resist the failures of the race  

> Lucky or unlucky, we didn't know  
> the race had failures of that order  
> and that we were going to share them  

> Like everyone else, we thought of ourselves as special  

> Your body is as vivid to me  
> as it ever was: even more  

> since my feeling for it is clearer:  
> I know what it could and could not do  

> it is no longer  
> the body of a god  
> or anything with power over my life  

> Next year it would have been 20 years  
> and you are wastefully dead  
> who might have made the leap  
> we talked, too late, of making  

> which I live now  
> not as a leap  
> but a succession of brief, amazing moments  

> each one making possible the next
