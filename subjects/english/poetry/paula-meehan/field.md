# Death of a Field by Paula Meehan

> The field itself is lost the morning it becomes a site  
> When the Notice goes up: Fingal County Council – 44 houses  

> The memory of the field is lost with the loss of its herbs  

> Though the woodpigeons in the willow  
> And the finches in what’s left of the hawthorn hedge  
> And the wagtail in the elder  
> Sing on their hungry summer song  

> The magpies sound like flying castanets  

> And the memory of the field disappears with its flora:  
> Who can know the yearning of yarrow  
> Or the plight of the scarlet pimpernel  
> Whose true colour is orange?  

> And the end of the field is the end of the hidey holes  
> Where first smokes, first tokes, first gropes  
> Were had to the scentless mayweed  

> The end of the field as we know it is the start of the estate  
> The site to be planted with houses each two or three bedroom  
> Nest of sorrow and chemical, cargo of joy  

> The end of dandelion is the start of Flash  
> The end of dock is the start of Pledge  
> The end of teazel is the start of Ariel  
> The end of primrose is the start of Brillo  
> The end of thistle is the start of Bounce  
> The end of sloe is the start of Oxyaction  
> The end of herb robert is the start of Brasso  
> The end of eyebright is the start of Fairy  

> Who amongst us is able to number the end of grasses  
> To number the losses of each seeding head?  

> I’ll walk out once  
> Barefoot under the moon to know the field  
> Through the soles of my feet to hear  
> The myriad leaf lives green and singing  
> The million million cycles of being in wing  

> That – before the field become solely map memory  
> In some archive of some architect’s screen  
> I might possess it or it possess me  
> Through its night dew, its moon white caul  
> Its slick and shine and its prolifigacy  
> In every wingbeat in every beat of time
