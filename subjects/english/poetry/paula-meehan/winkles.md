# Buying Winkles by Paula Meehan

> My mother would spare me sixpence and say,  
> ‘Hurry up now and don’t be talking to strange  
> men on the way.’ I’d dash from the ghosts  
> on the stairs where the bulb had blown  
> out into Gardiner Street, all relief.  
> A bonus if the moon was in the strip of sky  
> between the tall houses, or stars out,  
> but even in rain I was happy – the winkles  
> would be wet and glisten blue like little  
> night skies themselves. I’d hold the tanner tight  
> and jump every crack in the pavement,  
> I’d wave up to women at sills or those  
> lingering in doorways and weave a glad path through  
> men heading out for the night.  

> She’d be sitting outside the Rosebowl Bar  
> on an orange-crate, a pram loaded  
> with pails of winkles before her.  
> When the bar doors swung open they’d leak  
> the smell of men together with drink  
> and I’d see light in golden mirrors.  
> I envied each soul in the hot interior.  

> I’d ask her again to show me the right way  
> to do it. She’d take a pin from her shawl –  
> ‘Open the eyelid. So. Stick it in  
> till you feel a grip, then slither him out.  
> Gently, mind.’ The sweetest extra winkle  
> that brought the sea to me.  
> ‘Tell yer Ma I picked them fresh this morning.’  

> I’d bear the newspaper twists  
> bulging fat with winkles  
> proudly home, like torches.

## Symbolism
- The dark stairway could symbolise the poverty and bleakness of tenement life
- "ghosts on the stairs" possibly represent the child's imagination thinking of ghosts and monsters, but could also allude to the people who lived in the building that died, as the mortality rates during the tenement life was extremely high
- The girl carrying the wrapped winkles like torches symbolises the triumph the girl feels, like an olympian
