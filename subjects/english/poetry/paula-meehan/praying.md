# Praying for the Children of Longing by Paula Meehan

> Great tree from the far northern forest  
> Still rich with the sap of the forest  
> Here at the heart of winter  
> Here at the heart of the city  

> Grant us the clarity of ice  
> The comfort of snow  
> The cool memory of trees  
> Grant us the forest’s silence  
> The snow’s breathless quiet  

> For one moment to freeze  
> The scream, the siren, the knock on the door  
> The needle in its track  
> The knife in the back  

> In that silence let us hear  
> The song of the children of longing  
> In that silence let us catch  
> The breath of the children of longing  

> The echo of their voices through the city streets  
> The streets that defeated them  
> That brought them to their knees  
> The streets that couldn’t shelter them  
> That spellbound them in alleyways  
> The streets that blew their minds  
> That led them astray, out of reach of our saving  
> The streets that gave them visions and dreams  
> That promised them everything  
> That delivered nothing  
> The streets that broke their backs  
> The streets we brought them home to  

> Let their names be the wind through the branches  
> Let their names be the song of the river  
> Let their names be the holiest prayers  

> Under the starlight, under the moonlight  
> In the light of this tree  

> Here at the heart of winter  
> Here at the heart of the city
