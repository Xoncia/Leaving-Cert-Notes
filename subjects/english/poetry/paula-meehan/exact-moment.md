# The Exact Moment I Became a Poet (for Kay Foran) by Paula Meehan

> was in 1963 when Miss Shannon  
> rapping the duster on the easel’s peg  
> half obscured by a cloud of chalk  

> said Attend to your books, girls,  
> or mark my words, you’ll end up   
> in the sewing factory.  

> It wasn’t just that some of the girls’  
> mothers worked in the sewing factory  
> or even that my own aunt did,  

> and many neighbours, but  
> that those words ‘end up’ robbed  
> the labour of its dignity.  

> Not that I knew it then,  
> not in those words—labour, dignity.  
> That’s all back construction,  

> making sense; allowing also  
> the teacher was right  
> and no one knows it like I do myself.  

> But: I saw them: mothers, aunts and neighbours  
> trussed like chickens  
> on a conveyor belt,  

> getting sewn up the way my granny  
> sewed the sage and onion stuffing  
> in the birds.  

> Words could pluck you,  
> leave you naked,  
> your lovely shiny feathers all gone.
