# Them Ducks Died for Ireland by Paula Meehan

> “6 of our waterfowl were killed or shot, 7 of the garden  
>   seats broken and about 300 shrubs destroyed.”  
>     Park Superintendent in his report on the damage to  
>       St. Stephen’s Green, during the Easter Rising 1916  

> Time slides slowly down the sash window  
> puddling in light on oaken boards. The Green  
> is a great lung, exhaling like breath on the pane  
> the seasons’ turn, sunset and moonset, the ebb and flow  

> of stars. And once made mirror to smoke and fire,  
> a Republic’s destiny in a Countess’ stride,  
> the bloodprice both summons and antidote to pride.  
> When we’ve licked the wounds of history, wounds of war,  

> we’ll salute the stretcher bearer, the nurse in white,  
> the ones who pick up the pieces, who endure,  
> who live at the edge, and die there and are known  

> by this archival footnote read by fading light;  
> fragile as a breathmark on the windowpane or the gesture  
> of commemorating heroes in bronze and stone.
