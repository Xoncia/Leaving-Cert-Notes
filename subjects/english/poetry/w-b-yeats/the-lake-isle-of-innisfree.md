# The Lake Isle of Innisfree by W. B. Yeats

> I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,  
> And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;  
> Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,  
> And live alone in the bee-loud glade.  

> And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,  
> Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;  
> There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,  
> And evening full of the linnet’s wings.  

> I will arise and go now, for always night and day  
> I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;  
> While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,  
> I hear it in the deep heart’s core.
