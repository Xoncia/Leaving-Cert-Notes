# The Stare’s Nest By My Window (From Meditations In Time Of Civil War, VI) by W.B. Yeats

> The bees build in the crevices  
> Of loosening masonry, and there  
> The mother birds bring grubs and flies.  
> My wall is loosening, honey bees  
> Come build in the empty house of the stare.  

> We are closed in, and the key is turned  
> On our uncertainty; somewhere  
> A man is killed, or a house burned,  
> Yet no clear fact to be discerned:  
> Come build in the empty house of the stare  

> A barricade of stone or of wood;  
> Some fourteen days of civil war;  
> Last night they trundled down the road  
> That dead young soldier in his blood:  
> Come build in the empty house of the stare.  

> We had fed the heart on fantasies,  
> The heart’s grown brutal from the fare,  
> More substance in our enmities  
> Than in our love; oh, honey-bees  
> Come build in the empty house of the stare.
