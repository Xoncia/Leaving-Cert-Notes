# An Irish Airman Foresees his Death by W.B. Yeats

> I know that I shall meet my fate  
> Somewhere among the clouds above;  
> Those that I fight I do not hate,  
> Those that I guard I do not love;  
> My country is Kiltartan Cross,  
> My countrymen Kiltartanâ€™s poor,  
> No likely end could bring them loss  
> Or leave them happier than before.  
> Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,  
> Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,  
> A lonely impulse of delight  
> Drove to this tumult in the clouds;  
> I balanced all, brought all to mind,  
> The years to come seemed waste of breath,  
> A waste of breath the years behind  
> In balance with this life, this death.
