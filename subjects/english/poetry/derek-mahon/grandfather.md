# Grandfather by Derek Mahon

> They brought him in on a stretcher from the world,  
> Wounded but humorous; and he soon recovered.  
> Boiler-rooms, row upon row of gantries rolled  
> Away to reveal the landscape of a childhood  
> Only he can recapture. Even on cold  
> Mornings he is up at six with a block of wood  
> Or a box of nails, discreetly up to no good  
> Or banging round the house like a four-year-old —  

> Never there when you call. But after dark  
> You hear his great boots thumping in the hall  
> And in he comes, as cute as they come. Each night  
> His shrewd eyes bolt the door and wind the clock  
> Against the future, then his light goes out.  
> Nothing escapes him; he escapes us all.
