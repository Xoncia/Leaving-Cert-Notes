# The Chinese Restaurant in Portrush by Derek Mahon

> Before the first visitor comes the spring  
> Softening the sharp air of the coast  
> In time for the first seasonal ‘invasion.’  
> Today the place is as it might have been,  
> Gentle and almost hospitable. A girl  
> Strides past the Northern Counties Hotel,  
> Light-footed, swinging a book-bag,  
> And the doors that were shut all winter  
> Against the north wind and the sea mist  
> Lie open to the street, where one  
> By one the gulls go window-shopping  
> And an old wolfhound dozes in the sun.  

> While I sit with my paper and prawn chow mein  
> Under a framed photograph of Hong Kong  
> The proprietor of the Chinese restaurant  
> Stands at the door as if the world were young,  
> Watching the first yacht hoist a sail -  
> An ideogram on sea-cloud – and the light  
> Of heaven upon the hills of Donegal;  
> And whistles a little tune, dreaming of home.
