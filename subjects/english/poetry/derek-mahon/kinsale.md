# Kinsale by Derek Mahon

> The kind of rain we knew is a thing of the past â€“  
> deep-delving, dark, deliberate you would say,  
> browsing on spire and bogland; but today  
> our sky-blue slates are steaming in the sun,  
> our yachts tinkling and dancing in the bay  
> like racehorses. We contemplate at last  
> shining windows, a future forbidden to no one.
