# Antartica (for Richard Ryan) by Derek Mahon

> ‘I am just going outside and may be some time.’  
> The others nod, pretending not to know.  
> At the heart of the ridiculous, the sublime.  

> He leaves them reading and begins to climb,  
> goading his ghost into the howling snow;  
> he is just going outside and may be some time.  

> The tent recedes beneath its crust of rime  
> and frostbite is replaced by vertigo:  
> at the heart of the ridiculous, the sublime.  

> Need we consider it some sort of crime,  
> this numb self-sacrifice of the weakest? No,  
> he is just going outside and may be some time  

> in fact, for ever. Solitary enzyme,  
> though the night yield no glimmer there will glow,  
> at the heart of the ridiculous, the sublime.  

> He takes leave of the earthly pantomime  
> quietly, knowing it is time to go.  
> ‘I am just going outside and may be some time.’  
> At the heart of the ridiculous, the sublime.
