# Day Trip in Donegal by Derek Mahon

> We reached the sea in early afternoon,  
> climbed stiffly out; there were things to be done,  
> clothes to be picked up, friends to be seen.  
> As ever, the nearby hills were a deeper green  
> than anywhere in the world, and the grave  
> grey of the sea the grimmer in that enclave.  

> Down at the pier the boats gave up their catch,  
> a squirming glimmer of gills. They fetch  
> ten times as much in the city as there,  
> and still the fish come in year after year —  
> herring and mackerel, flopping about the deck  
> in attitudes of agony and heartbreak.  

> We left at eight, drove back the way we came,  
> the sea receding down each muddy lane.  
> Around midnight we changed down into suburbs  
> sunk in a sleep no gale-force wind disturbs.  
> The time of year had left its mark  
> on frosty pavements glistening in the dark.  

> Give me a ring, goodnight, and so to bed . . .  
> That night the slow sea washed against my head,  
> performing its immeasurable erosions —  
> spilling into the skull, marbling the stones  
> that spine the very harbour wall,  
> muttering its threat to villages of landfall.  

> At dawn I was alone far out at sea  
> without skill or reassurance — nobody  
> to show me how, no promise of rescue —  
> cursing my constant failure to take due  
> forethought for this; contriving vain  
> overtures to the vindictive wind and rain.
