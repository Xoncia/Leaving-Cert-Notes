# As It Should Be by Derek Mahon

> We hunted the mad bastard  
> Through bog, moorland, rock, to the starlit west  
> And gunned him down in a blind yard  
> Between ten sleeping lorries  
> And an electricity generator.  

> Let us hear no idle talk  
> Of the moon in the Yellow River;  
> The air blows softer since his departure.  

> Since his tide-burial during school hours  
> Our children have known no bad dreams.  
> Their cries echo lightly along the coast.  

> This is as it should be.  
> They will thank us for it when they grow up  
> To a world with method in it.
