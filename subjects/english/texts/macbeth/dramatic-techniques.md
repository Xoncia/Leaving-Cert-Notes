## Imagery

### Blood

Blood symbolises murder and guilt throughout this tragedy.

There are 2 colours repeated through out the play, black and red. The frequent references to there colours create an atmosphere of darkness, violence and horror.

Images of blood are used to establish Macbeth as a terrifying killer before we ever meet him. We are told by the Sargent in Act 1 Scene 2 that he cut the traitor in two from his groin to his jaw **"he unseamed him from the have to the chops"**. Despite the fact that these actions are barbaric, Macbeth is viewed as a hero being so bruted.

Lady Macbeth is also associated with blood and violence. Before Duncan's murder, she calls for her blood to be made, so thick that she will feel neither pity nor remorse. By this, she means that she wants to harden her heart to an act she knows is purely evil of course, she fails and later proves to be incapable of coping with her guilt.

The killing of Duncan is made even more horrifying by the images of blood. As he prepares to murder the king, Macbeth hallucinates and sees a dagger with **"gouts of blood"** on the blade and handle.

Immediately after the deed, Macbeth is appalled by the amount of blood on his hands, called it **"a sorry sight"**. He believes that if he were to dip his hands in the seas, they would turn red: **"no this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine making the green one red"**.

Macbeth's first order as king is to order the death of his former friend and comrade in arms, Banquo. This is a shocking betrayal of their bond, and it reinforced Macbeth's moral decline and his commitment to a rule pf violent tyranny Banquo's murder is described in gory detail. He is left with **"twenty trenched gashes on his head"** and Macbeth is pleased to note that the murder who reports back to him is covered in Banquo's blood **"Tis better thee without than he within"**. Banquo's bloody ghost appears at the banquet later that evening, shaking it's **"gory locks"** unnerving Macbeth and causing him to tell his wife that "blood will have blood". By this he means that he who sheds blood will have his own blood spilled (foreshadowing).

The most famous reference to blood in the play is Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. She is tormented by the memory of Duncan's murder, despite saying at the time **"A little water clears us of this deed"**. Now no amount of water can make the blood vanish from her imagination or rid her of her guilt. Lady Macbeth wanders the castel at night, vainly trying to scrub the stain away **"out damed spot, out, I say"**.

Images of blood are used in a more positive way to symbolise the sacrifice those loyal to Scotland are wiling to make in order that Malcolm claim the throne of Scotland.

The play ends as it began, with the defeat of a traitor and the restoration of order.

### Nature

Macbeth is typical of Shakespeare's tragedies in that the natural world of the play reflects key aspects of the plot. The imagery of disease acts as a metaphor for evil. Nature or the natural world also represents feelings for the actions of the characters and it therefore reflects their emotional state, this is known as pathetic fallacy

The opening scene of Macbeth gives us an indication of the Witches' nature and intentions. They meet on a heath in a foul mist and plan their next gathering "In thunder, lightening, or in rain". Stormy weather is a sign that evil is afoot

When the Sergeant is describing to Duncan in Act 1 Scene 2, he also uses storm imagery, subtly linking Macbeth to the Witches and prefiguring the disorder that is to come: "As whatever the sun 'gins his reflection. / Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break, / So from that spring whence comfort seemed to come. / Discomfort swells."

At the same time, the Sergeant compares Macbeth and Banquo to eagles and lions when describing their bravery and strength on the battlefield. This positive imagery highlights the pairs nobility as well as their courage: both eagles and lions are traditionally associated with courage and honour.

is hoarse from saying again and again that King Duncan must die. When King Duncan comes to Macbeth's castle, he remarks how sweet the air is, Banquo agrees, and adds:

**"This quest is summer,    
The temple haunting martlet, does approve      
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath        
Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze      
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird       
Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle."**

A 'market' is a house martin (kind of swallow), which is 'temple-haunting' because it likes to build its nest high on the walls of tall buildings. ("Haunting" doesn't have any ghostly connotations here.) When Lady Macbeth heard that King Duncan was coming for the night, she imagined a raven under her battlements, foretelling the death of the King. Instead _

_ case can reflect the natures of the characters

Lady Macduff's young son on hearing ______ mother that he shall live **"as birds do"**.

When he hears of the murder of his wife and children Macduff cries **"What, all my pretty chickens and their dam/At one fell swoop?".** He calls Macbeth a "hell-kite", thus likening him to a hawk who has likening him to a hawk who has killed all his 'pretty chickens' in one, swoop or dive.

## Soliloquies

The soliloquy is a speech delivered by a single character on stage, the character will appear to be thinking aloud. It allows the breakdown of what is often referred to as the fourth wall that separates the audience from the stage.

An aside is a similar dramatic technique the difference is that the character does not need to be alone. When a character makes and aside, the audience can hear every word but the other characters present are oblivious.

Some of the plays most powerful language is found in Macbeth's speeches. Soliloquies contribute greatly to his characterisation as a tragic hero, because we know the true state of Macbeth's mind, we understand his dilemma as he contemplates the murder of Duncan.  He is acutely aware that this course of action is wrong, but the temptation to be king is so strong that it eventually overrides all his concerns. n Macbeth, the protagonist has the greatest number of soliloquies. This adds to our experience of the drama as we share in his fears and anxieties.

Macbeth's soliloquies are:
- Act 1, Scene 3: "Two truths are told..."
- Act 1, Scene 7: "If it were done, when 'tis done..."
- Act 2, Scene 1: "Is this a dagger which I see before me...?"
- Act 3, Scene 1: "To be thus is nothing..."
- Act 5, Scene 3: "I have lived long enough..."
- Act 5, Scene 5: "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow..."

In his (Macbeth) first soliloquy (Act 1, Scene 3), Macbeth is considering what the witches have promised him. Their prophecies have already made a deep impact and his desire for power is starting to take hold. He ignores Banquo's warning and focuses instead on the possibility of becoming Scotland's next king. The witches have been proved right on two counts: they recognised that Macbeth was Thane of Glamis; and now he has been rewarded with the new title of Thane of Cawdor. Yet he wonders if their soliciting is to be fully trusted. What disturbs him most is his own evil ambition.
