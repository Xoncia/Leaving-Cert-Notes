Macbeth is a tragic hero. Initially, he is presented as a hero returning from battle his prowess on the battlefield indicated that he is also capable of brutality towards those he views as enemies. It is mentioned that he cut an opponent in two with his broadsword. *On his return he encounters 3 witches (Weird Sisters) who prophesies that he will become the Thane of Cawdor and that he will one day wear the crown of Scotland. He questions this but it also leads him to acknowledging that he somewhere in his mind has secretly held this ambition. His friends Banquo who is with him also receives information that he will father a line of kings but will never himself be king. Both men then encounter some other soldiers who inform Macbeth that he has been made Thane of Cawdor which indicates that the prophecy is true.* 

(*italic* = summary)

Macbeth's reaction to the prophecy is skeptical although he does realise that he is ambitious although he does realise that he is ambitious he puts it to the back of the mind. However, when the first part becomes true he then writes to his wife informing her of what has happened.

When he arrives home Macbeth allow his weaknesses to be exploited by his wife enabling her to manipulate him into action in hope of fulfilling the rest of the prophecy. We learn that Macbeth conforms to the traditional gender roles of the time. When his masculinity, bravery, ambition and love for his wife is questioned, he goes along with his wife's plans.

Following the murder of Duncan, Macbeth initially reacts in a manner that we would expect, he is skittish, he doesn't what to do in the situation and relies on his wife to help him cover up his crime.

Macbeth the once trusted and reliable citizen and friend now turns his attention towards Banquo, who he thinks will suspect him of his crime. Macbeth has killed his king and now plans to kill his friend and comrade in arms. Instead of getting his own hands dirty he hires hitmen to murder Banquo and his son, to prevent this part of the prophecy becoming reality. However Macbeth's plan fails and Fleance escapes. Macbeth is then faced with the ghost of Banquo the apportion is only visible to Macbeth guilt. His wife does her best to take control of the situation, as Macbeth's guests at the feast are increasingly aware that Macbeth is not sound of mind.

Macbeth's marriage seems to collapse and the two are not together following the banquet scene, he speaks of what must be done for **"mine own good"**, the marriage is all but over and Macbeth who once relied heavily on his wife now relies more and more on the witches. Macbeth gains confidence having visited the witches and asking for advice, he believes he is all but invincible for only a man not born of woman can kill him, something that seems impossible and that his reign will end when Birnam wood marches to Dunsinane hill. This new found confidence in his reign leads to Macbeth becoming even more violent and tyrannical. He enacts revenge on Macduff by having his wife and children murdered, indicating that no one not even innocent women and children are safe under his rule. 

Even when faced with the news that forces have arrived from England to Dunsinane hill. He continues to have faith in the prophecy.

While this is happening Macbeth is also informed by Seyton, that Lady Macbeth is dead, Macbeth's response reminds us of his humanity. It highlights the importance of his wife to him. **"She should have died hereafter      
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,         
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day"**

Modern English translation of quote: (She should have died later and that he wishes he had another tomorrow with his wife, that all the tomorrows he had with her creeped in and were wasted without realising that they were numbered)

Macbeth relies on the witches prediction even when his soldiers are forced to surrender. He engages in combat with Macbeth confident that he is invincible but Macduff informs him of his birth, **"Tell thee Macduff was from his mother's womb   
Untimely ripped."**

Macbeth faced with his demise ultimately surrenders to his fate and declares that he will fight to his death once again reminding us of his bravery and honour.

The once valiant, honourable and brave Macbeth was corrupted by ambition and then power, which ultimately led to his isolation, decent into tyranny, paranoia, madness and finally his death. The one somewhat redeeming quality of Macbeth is the love and respect he showed for his wife.

## Lady Macbeth

- Loyal
- Ambitious
- Confident
- Loving wife
- Untrustworthy
- Domineering
- Ruthless
- Power Hungry
- Manipulative

Lady Macbeth is a supportive and loving wife. She defies traditional gender roles by being ambitious and power hungry. The relationship between herself and her husband also goes against the norm for the time in that Macbeht values her opinion.

Lady Macbeth is consumed with the idea of becoming queen once she hears of the prophecy and manipulates her husband to murder Duncan. She is the person who plans Duncan's murder and when her husband shows reluctance, she calls him names, questions his manhood and informs him that he doesn't love her, unless he does as she asks.

Following the murder of Duncan it is Lady Macbeth that remains coll, calm and collected, she reassures her husband and takes charge of the situation. Her mindset reminds us of her earlier plea to **"unsex me"** as she doesn't want to be seen as a weak woman and pleads to have the qualities of a man. She also begs that the ability to have children is taken away from her as she associates this with femininity and therefore weakness.

This scene is played out again, but with different consequences. Following the death of Banquo, Lady Macbeth covers for her husband with the banquet when he sees the ghost. However, rather that bringing the couple closer together, Macbeth has become less dependant on her and they become estranged. **"How now my lord! Why do you keep alone...?"**

Macbeth and his wife are not together again in the play. In Act 4 Scene 2, Macbeth murders Lady Macduff and her children, these were innocent victims and had posed no physical threat to Macbeth's position as King, this potentially led to Lady Macbeth's realisation that the man she loved has gone and been replaced by an immoral murderous monster.

By Act 5 Scene 1, the once confident and ruthless Lady Macbeth is reduced to a mere shadow and is gone completely mad, sleepwalking and imagining blood on her hands that she cannot wash clean. The doctor informs Macbeth that he cannot treat Lady Macbeth because her illness is mental and not physical.

We are then informed that Lady Macbeth has died offstage, the assumption is that she has committed suicide as the guilt and her mental anguish has become too much for her to bare.

Lady Macbeth blinded by ambition becomes blinded by guilt having succeeded in achieving her aim of obtaining the crown through violence and commits suicide as she goes insane. Their redeeming feature is the loyalty and love she shows for her husband.

## Banquo

- Brave
- Noble
- Loyal
- Honest
- Sceptical
- Patriotic
- Unfortunate
- Strong willed
- Cowardly

He is introduced as a comrade of Macbeth and of equal status, he is a war hero. He serves as a foil of Macbeth. They both hear prophecies from the witches, but he doesn't act on the information he received like Macbeth. Banquo becomes suspicious of Macbeth following the murder of Duncan, because he knows of the prophecy.

Banquo meets his untimely death at the hands of a hitman because he knows about the prophecy and could pose a threat to Macbeth and his tyranny.
