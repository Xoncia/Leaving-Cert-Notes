## Central Characters

At the beginning of the play Nora is not presented in a particularly sympathetic light. She appears immature and overly dependent on her husband’s opinion of her. Her language is childish: she tells Torvald that he will have ‘a big salary and earn lots of money’ and begs him to let her spend ‘a tiny wee bit’ more money at Christmas. Torvald rebukes Nora for what he sees as her irresponsible attitude towards the household finances and she meekly accepts his judgement. When Torvald suspects Nora has been eating sweets, he treats her as if she is his daughter rather than his wife, asking, ‘Hasn’t Miss Sweet Tooth been breaking rules in town today?’ The idea that Torvald believes he has the right to control what Nora eats gives us little hope of her achieving any real freedom and fulfilment in her life, an idea that is reinforced when she assures him, ‘I should not think of going against your wishes.’ Of course, we know that Nora is lying to Torvald and that she has been eating macaroons. This little lie dimply serves to make Nora’s situation more depressing: she cannot be honest with her husband or true to herself in his presence.

Nora’s initial treatment of her friend Christine Linde does little to improve our impression of her. Christine has been a widow for three years and Nora admits that she never wrote to express her condolences, saying, ‘I meant ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off and something always prevented me’. When Christine tells Nora that her husband left her childless and penniless, Nora immediately points out that she herself has ‘three lovely children’ and that Torvald’s promotion means they will soon have ‘heaps and heaps of money’ and no anxiety about the future. Nora appears little more than a selfish, frivolous woman at this stage in the play and her attitude contributes to a negative general vision and viewpoint.

As the play progresses, we begin to see there is more depth to Nora’s character than we could have suspected from her initial interactions with Torvald and Christine. She is stung when Christine says she knows ‘so little of the burdens and troubles of life’ and that she is simply ‘a child’. In order to prove that she is not ‘incapable of anything serious’, Nora reveals that she took out a secret loan to pay for a trip to Italy when Torvald was seriously ill. This is the starting proof that Nora has a will of her own and the ability to make decisions without Torvald’s knowledge or permission. This information creates a slightly more positive vision and viewpoint in that we now know Nora is a deeper character than she first appeared, and we are more interested and engaged with her character as a result. While we might not admire the means Nora employs, we can understand her goal. It is incredibly difficult for Nora to pay back the money she has borrowed: she has to take on work behind Torvald’s back and scrimp and save to meet the repayments. She succeeds admirably, driven by her great love for her husband and family. Nora’s strength of character is clear but her decision to break the law makes us fear that the story may not end well. The revelation to Christine raises two obstacles to any improvement in Nora’s situation. First, we know that Torvald will not tolerate any deviation from his rules and that is dead set against loans of any sort. Second, the fact that Nora has been lying to her husband about such an important matter is further proof that she is in a dysfunctional and unequal relationship.

Torvald is an antagonistic force in the play and his behaviour contributes to a depressing general vision and viewpoint. It is difficult to feel any sympathy for such a selfish, pompous and controlling character. His fury when he discovers the truth about the loan seems to put an end to any hope of a happy ending. Torvald is incredulous that Nora had behaved so irresponsibly and he is far more concerned with his reputation than he is with his marriage. He scorns Nora’s claim that the will be fineif she is ‘out of the way’. Ironically, Torvald rails at the possibility of being blackmailed by Krogstad, saying it is dreadful to think of being in thrall to such a man: ‘he can do what he likes with me, ask anything he likes of me, give me any orders he pleases -  I dare not refuse’. It never seems to occur to Torvald that this is exactly the sort of life he has forced Nora to lead.

When Krogstad withdraws his threat of blackmail, Torvald immediately changes his tune. He tells Nora that all is well and that their marriage can continue ‘just as it was before’. There is no real hope or optimism in this, however. Torvald couches his forgiveness in terms that show he only cares about himself, saying, ‘There is something so indescribably sweet and satisfying’ in pardoning her and that it is now as if he has made Nora ‘doubly his own’ so she had ‘become both wife and child to him’. He assures her that he will do all the thinking for her in the future, ostensibly to spare her anxiety but really to ensure that she never disobeys him again. This little speech seems to put paid to any chance of Nora achieving personal fulfilment: she will be even more under Torvald’s control than before if she accepts these terms.
