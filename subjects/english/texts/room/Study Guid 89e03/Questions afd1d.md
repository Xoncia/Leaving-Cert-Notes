## **Activities**

### A day in Room (Pg. 46)

It’s clear that Jack’s happiness is very important to Ma.  In order to keep him a healthy and pleasant little boy, Ma has to create various activities to ensure he got his exercise and play time. It’s your job to create a new game that can be done in their tiny space.

### Dialogue (Pgs. 73-74)

Imagine you are Ma and you plan on telling 5 year old Jack the truth about the real world.  What would you say to him to make him understand?

- With a partner, write a short scene between Ma and Jack (about 10 lines of dialogue each)
- Pretend Ma is trying to explain to Jack about the Outside.
- Keep in mind what kind of actions/reactions each of the characters would display.
- Where in Room is Ma telling him this?
- Does Jack understand what you are talking about?

### Character Maps (Pg. 122)

Now that you have read three parts of Room, it’s time to brainstorm some characteristics.  Draw a spider graph showing the characteristics for the characters of Jack, Ma and Old Nick.  Characterisation includes showing the character’s physical traits, displaying the character’s actions, revealing their thoughts, the way in which they speak and their reactions to others.  Use quotes to support your spider diagram.

### Police Report (Pg. 193)

Pretend that you are a Police Officer and you are filling out a report after interviewing Ajeet (the man who found Jack).  Fill in the blank report (page 6) with as many details as you can; use reference and quotes from the novel.

### TV News Report (Pg. 205)

Pretend that you are the news reporter on the TV.  Fill in the details on the form (page 7) and then write your report.  You will be then reading your report aloud in class.

### Newspaper Article (Pg. 298)

You are a journalist for a local newspaper.  Write a newspaper article about Jack and Ma’s life in captivity, and their ultimate escape.  Mention also about how their life has been since their escape.  Remember to follow the rules for writing newspaper articles.

### Diary Entry (Pg. 312)

After Ma and Jack escape from Room, the two spend time at a very special clinic.  Ma is given a notebook and instructed to keep a diary as part of her recovery.  You have to write a journal/diary entry in Ma’s voice.  This entry should be at least 500 words.  Use the following questions as a guide:

- What is she thinking about now that she’s fully regained her freedom?
- What are some goals she has for herself? For Jack?
- What emotions is she now feeling?
- How does she think she will settle back into society? How will Jack settle into the outside world?
- What was it like being held captive?
- How does she feel towards Old Nick?
- How does she feel about reconnecting with her family?
- Any other emotions or ideas Ma may be thinking about.
