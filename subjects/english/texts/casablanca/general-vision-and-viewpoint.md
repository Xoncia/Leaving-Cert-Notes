## Central Characters

Our view of the integrity of a central character, as well as their ability to find fulfilment over the course of the text, colours our general vision and viewpoint. Rick Blaine is a self-contained, somewhat enigmatic figure at the start of the film. He owns a popular café and is well-known in the city. Captain Renault tells Major Strasser, the Third Reich representative who has recently arrived in the city, that ‘everybody comes to Rick’s and the German replies that he has already heard about Rick’s café and ‘about Mr Rick himself’.

Rick keeps himself to himself and, although he is polite and even friendly on occasion, he never drinks with customers, preferring to sit alone and watch the goings on in the café from a discreet distance. He has a lover, Yvonne, but shows little interest in her and resists all her attempts to arrange another date. Rick’s treatment of Yvonne is quite callous, as it is clear she cares a great deal for him. Renault tells Major Strasser: ‘Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too’. However, this neutrality does not make Rick particularly admirable. As Casablanca is both a love story and a political allegory of the Second World War, Rick’s disinterest in German occupation conveys a negative and pessimistic message . This is deliberate, because in the early part of the film, Rick represents the American isolationist approach to the war. Over the course of the film, there are several unsubtle links between Rick and American political views. When Renault tells Rick that Ugarte will be arrested in this bar and that he not interfere with the process, Rick says, ‘I stick my neck out for nobody’. Renault approvingly calls this ‘A wise foreign policy’.

There are hints, however, that Rick’s sympathies lie more with the Allies than the Germans and that he is at heart, a king and decent man who cares for those around him, despite his best efforts to appear cynical and aloof. These little flashes of hope create a sense of optimism, albeit briefly. Major Strasser has a dossier on Rick that shows that in the past, Rick was far from neutral and even risked his life to fight for what he believed was right. Strasser says he knows what Rick did in Paris and why he left Paris. Renault also has information about Rick, reminding him that for all his claim not to care about the war, he has fought against oppression before: ‘Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.’

On a personal level, Rick shows his true nature quietly and without fuss. One seemingly irrelevant incident is Rick’s reaction to Emil, the croupier, telling him that a customer has had a big win at the casino. Rick takes the news calmly and assures Emil that he does not mind. We see the same decency in the way Rick treats Sam. He will not ‘sell’ him to Ferrari and insists that they ask Sam is he would like to switch employment. Sam refuses, reinforcing the idea that Rick is an admirable man who inspires loyalty and gratitude in those close to him. Similarly, Rick’s generosity to Annina Brandel, rigging the roulette table so her husband wins enough money to allow them passage to America is a king and selfless act. All of these small moments build up a picture of a man wo may well be capable of heroism and who is not indifferent to the plight of others.

Rick and Ilsa’s reunion throws Rick off balance and, for a time, his behaviour is far from admirable. His bitterness and pain come to the fore and he is incapable of seeing past his own suffering. The mood of the film becomes deeply pessimistic when Rick refuses to give Ilsa and Laszlo the letters of transit. His change of heart when he realises Ilsa truly loves him after all rekindles our hope that perhaps all will be well, and shows Rick at his beat once more.

Rick’s ultimate act of self-sacrifice at the end of the film contributes to a positive and optimistic general vision and viewpoint. Heroically, he insists that Ilsa and Laszlo escape to America together and, in some of the most often quoted lines form the film, tells Ilssa, ‘I’ve got a job to do, too. Where I’m going you can’t follow. What I’ve got to do you can’t be any part of. Ilsa, I’m no good at being noble, but it doesn’t take much to see that the problems of three little people don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you’ll understand that.’ Rick shows great integrity in allowing the woman he loves to go away with another man because he knows that the war effort is more important than any individual. Even the self-serving Renault is moved by Rick’s nobility and decides to abandon his post and join Rick on his quest to resist the Germans and help the Allied war effort. The sadness of Rick and Ilsa’s parting cannot dampen the positive and uplifting mood caused by Rick’s idealistic, admirably selfless actions.
