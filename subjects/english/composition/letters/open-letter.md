## Writing an Open Letter

### Why write an open letter?

- To reach a wide audience
- To defend oneself, express a strong view or make an appeal
- Open letters are often aimed at an individual or group but are intended to be shared with the public

## Format of an Open Letter

The name of the author and date usually appear at the top of the letter, as in Sassoon’s example. However there is no hard and fast rule and if you prefer to sign at the end you may do so

There is no need for any address unless your sending it to a newspaper then you add their address not yours

If you wish to address your open letter to an individual or group, do so. You can do this by giving your open letter a title: “An open letter to all those who offer unwanted advice”

Provide reason why your writing letter in introduction

Your conclusion should be related to the point you made at the outset and should, ideally include some sort of call to action
