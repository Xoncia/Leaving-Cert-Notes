# Question

"Important themes are often expressed in key moments in texts."

Compare how the authors of the comparative texts studied by you used key moments to heighten your awareness of an important theme

# Answer

The three texts that I have studied, that show how key moments are used to heighten the awareness of an important theme are; 'King Lear' by William Shakespeare, 'Room' by Emma Donoghue and 'A Winter's Bone' directed by Debra Granik. While there are a range of themes which are strikingly relevant across each of the texts, the theme which stood out to me due to its dynamic principles and varying interaction levels was the theme of parenting. In this essay, I will be comparing how key moments from each of three texts heighten the reader's awareness of this theme.

Essentially, the importance of good parenting lies at the heart of 'King Lear' by William Shakespeare. We are immediately introduced to the theme in Act I, scene (i), where we meet Lear and his three daughters Goneril, Regan and Cordelia along with their respective husbands or suitors. We also meet Glocester and his two sons, Edgar (his legitimate son) and Edmund (illegitimate son). Lear attempts to divide his kingdom between his daughters based on the results of his "love test". Although his kingdom should be divided equally, Lear clearly loves Cordelia (his youngest daughter) more and wants to give her the largest section of his wealth. In return, Lear expects excessive flattery and gushing confessions of love. But instead,  Cordelia's reply is honest, "Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave, my heart into my mouth. I love your majesty according to my bond, mo more nor less." Her refusal to indulge her father has has disastrous consequences as Lear, against the protests of his loyal servant Kent, banishes her. In my opinion, this is the key moment that brings the theme into focus for the reader. This moment defines the play as we can't help but wonder, if Lear had listened to Cordelia and Kent, could the tragedy have been avoided? A parent should always be there for their child, but Lear was far too conceited to realise this.
