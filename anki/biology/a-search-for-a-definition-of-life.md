## There are 2 types of Metabolic Reactions

### Anabolic Reactions

These reactions use energy to join small molecules together to form larger molecules

Anabolic: small → big

Example: Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis Formula: Carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen

$$
6CO_2 + 6H_2O → C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2
$$

### Catabolic Reactions

These reactions use energy to break down large molecules into smaller ones

Catabolic: small ← big

Example: Respiration

## Continuity of Life

*Continuity of life is the ability of an organism to exist from generation to the next*

You need reproduction and heredity to achieve continuity

Genes are hereditary factors that are passed on from one generation to the next during reproduction

All living things reproduce

Viruses are not living because they don't have cells (we will come across this again later)
