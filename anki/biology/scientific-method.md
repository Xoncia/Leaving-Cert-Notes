## Areas of Study (You should know 3)

|Terms       |Definition                        |
|------------|----------------------------------|
|Botany      |The study of Plants               |
|Genetics    |The study of Genes and DNA        |
|Physiology  |The study of the Human Body       |
|Biochemistry|The study of Chemicals in the Body|
|Ecology     |The study of Nature               |
|Microbiology|The study of Micro-Organisms      |
|Horticulture|The study of Growing Plants       |


## Scientific Investigations

- Curiosity and observations lead to an idea/explanation of how something works
- Investigations into whether the idea is correct or not happen
- Sometimes the idea is correct and sometimes the idea is wrong
- The idea is shared with others, so they can investigate also

## Scientific Method based on

1. Making Observations
2. Forming a Hypothesis (suggested explanation-educated guess (Hypothesis (prediction) can be tested))
3. Design experiment
4. Collect & Interpret Data
5. Forming a conclusion
6. Communication (Publication in SCIENTIFIC Journals (on the internet is not accepted answer in LC exam))

## Definitions to Learn

|Terms       |Definition                         |
|------------|----------------------------------|
|Hypothesis  |An educated guess based on observations (“If ... Then ...”)|
|Experiment  |A test for a hypothesis           |
|Data        |The information gathered in experiments|
|A Theory    |An explanation based on repeated hypothesis and experimentation (Example: Theory of Evolution)|
|A Principle or Law|A principle or law arises from a theory when it is seen always to be true under all conditions over a long period of time (Example: Law of Gravity)|


### Small Pox and the Scientific Method

## Example: Vaccinations

### Observation

Milk maids do not get small pox (serious condition)

### Hypothesis

Milk maids get cow pox (mild condition) which protects them from small pox

### Experiment

Small boy was infected with cow pox and suffered cow pox. Two months later he was injected with small pox

### Result

Boy did not suffer small pox

### Conclusion

Cow pox protects from small pox. Cow pox fluid can be used to give immunity to small pox

*Edward Jenner – Experiment 1796*

## Scientific investigations lead to…

When a hypothesis is confirmed it can lead to a Theory

E.g. Theory of Evolution

When a theory is confirmed over many years it becomes a Scientific Principle

When a Principle is judged to be of great basic importance it is called a **Law**

E.g. Law of Gravity

Hypothesis → Theory → Principle → Law

## Limitations of the Scientific Method

Experiments are only based on current knowledge

Results are limited by our ability to interpret them

The natural world is in constant change (myxomatosis- rabbits now resistant to it)

### Dishonesty

In 1998, a report claiming MMR vaccine had links to autism

[Video: Not all scientific studies are created equal - David H. Schwartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUpd2HJHUt8)

### Accidents

The discovery of viagra

### Sample Size

If the Sample Size is too small, results cannot be trusted

---

### Experimental Design – A Fair Test

- Large sample size (if possible)
- Only one variable changes (fair test)
- Other variables remain constant
- **Replicate:** Repeat many times to verify result
- Use a control (a setup for comparison)
- Data must stand up to independent scrutiny

## Terminology

|Name        |Definition                        |Examples                        |
|------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|Qualitative Data|Descriptive/observations/subjective (Influenced by personal feelings)|Names, hair (color), nationality|
|Quantitative Data|Measurements/numbers/objective    |Age, height                     |
|Independent Variable|The variable that is being changed|                                |
|Dependent Variable|The variable that changes as a result of the independent variable|                                |


## Drug Testing on Humans (Definition to Learn)

|Name        |Definition                        |
|------------|----------------------------------|
|Placebo     |An identical tablet to the one being tested but which does not contain the drug. This is the control group.|
|Blind Test  |The individual does not know if they have received the drug or the placebo|
|Double Blind Test|The individual being tested and the test administrator does not know who is receiving the placebo|


## Ethics

Throughout this course we will come across scientific issues which have ethical implications

Ethical issues relate to what is right and what is wrong
