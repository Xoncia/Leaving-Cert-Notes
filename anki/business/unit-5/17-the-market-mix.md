### Branding

#### Branding (From Teacher)

- USP is main focus of branding
- Images, text, logos, phrases, shape, packaging, etc.
- Makes product interesting
- Customer loyalty
- Good brand can charge higher prices
- Easier to go global
- USP is main focus of branding

#### Benefits of Branding for a Company

- Helps to differentiate the product from rivals
    - A brand gives a product a clear identity that can make it instantly recognisable. This helps a business, as consumers are more likely to buy a brand if they know and trust it
        - A consumer shopping for a block of butter will probably recognise the Kerrygold brand, so may be more likely to buy it over other competitors like Glenstal butter.
- Opportunity to promote the brand, not just a product
    - A business that has developed a strong brand can choose to just promote the brand itself and not advertise each of its products. This marketing tool will help reduce costs. Advertising one of its products with the brand name might remind consumers of other products that the business sells too
        - McDonald’s launched an advert showing groups of people on the way to a wedding all stopping at its restaurants en route. This promoted all of the options the company sells, not just one restaurant or one meal
- Consumer Loyalty
    - A consumer might stay loyal to a brand over a long period of time. A business could release new products in its range aimed at diﬀerent age groups to target this
        - A consumer who grew up eating Kellogg’s Rice Krispies might choose Kellogg’s All Bran or Corn Flakes. Kellogg’s also offers Special K, giving consumers who might have eaten other Kellogg’s products a lower-calorie option

#### Benefits of Branding for a Consumer

- Gives confidence and peace of mind
    - When a consumer chooses a recognised brand, they might pay more for it, but feel more confidence in the brand. The consumer might think it is safer to choose a well-known brand when buying an expensive item or a new type of good they have not used before
        - A consumer might be happier to pay more for an Apple iPhone than a Sony mobile phone, as they know Apple is a popular brand in that market, so they would not worry as much about their decision to spend a lot of money
- Helps to judge a product
    - Brands help consumers to judge the expected quality or performance of different options. They can use branding to judge how long a product might last or if it is value for money. The country in which a brand is produced could also influence the consumer
        - Parma ham from Italy might be seen as superior to other hams, or French perfume superior to that of other countries
- Makes it easier to choose
    - A consumer is faced with so many decisions in a grocery or retail store. Easily recognisable logos and packaging can make decisions more straightforward, as certain brands are associated with a positive value, characteristic or position
        - If a consumer sees an Adidas logo on a pair of leggings, they know they are good quality

#### Own-brand (From Teacher)

- Offers cheaper alternative
- Bigger profit share for the company e.g. Dunnes
- Lead to repeat customers
- Easily recognisable product
- Speciality goods

|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Competitors|Pricing will position the product’s image against competitors in the market                                                                                                 |
|Consumers  |Expectations of satisfaction and norms for consumers                                                                                                                        |

|Demand     |If demand increases, companies may increase prices to match (e.g. concerts)                                                                                                 |

### Promotion (impact of ICT)

|Sales promotions|ICT has allowed for a much wider range of ‘share and win’ competitions on social media to incentivise sales. Businesses also ask consumers to sign up for newsletters in exchange for discount codes. Businesses use pop-ups on browsers and websites|
|Personal selling|ICT has allowed salespeople to use smartphones and tablets to illustrate products/services in action. Live Chat is used for direct online interaction                       |

|Agent    |Manufacturer ➔ Agent ➔ Consumer                                                                                                                                             |Insurance brokers|

### Factors for choosing a channel of distribution

| | |
|-|-|
|Profit margin|The more stages (e.g. wholesaler, retailer) involved, the less a business profits per item sold                                                                             |
|Type of good|Perishable goods are best sold direct. Mass produced goods are best sold through wholesalers who can ‘break bulk’ and sell to retailers                                     |
|Market size|Low-volume operations may suit a more direct channel (especially for job production), since orders might be custom made                                                     |
|Online presence|A business with lots of followers can sell directly through websites and social media. This is useful if the target market regularly uses devices                           |
|Technology|Apps such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo provide platforms where manufacturers can sell (which enables higher sales)                                                            |
