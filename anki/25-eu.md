## Different types of rules the EU can make

|  |  |
|-|-|
| EU directive | Allows each member state to decide on how to achieve a particular result that the EU requires member states to reach within a certain time limit |
| EU regulation | Becomes enforceable immediately as law in its entirety in all member states simultaneously |
| EU decision | A legal instrument the EU can use that is binding upon specific people or countries |

## Special interest groups in the EU
Special interest groups play a role in the EU decision-making process, particularly during the consultation stage

Most are based in Brussels/Strasbourg. They lobby, protest and use information campaigns to promote the views of their members (e.g. Irish Farmers' Association)
