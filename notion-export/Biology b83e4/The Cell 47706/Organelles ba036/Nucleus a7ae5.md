A large organelle near the center of the cell is the NUCLEUS

The control center of the cell is the nucleus

## Whatâ€™s in a nucleus?

The nucleus is made up of a double membrane with numerous nuclear pores

These control the movement of substances into and out of the nucleus

A nucleolus which contains RNA, DNA, and Proteins and it makes Ribosomes

Chromatin which contains DNA that is arranged into chromosomes which stores our genes

Since DNA cannot leave the nucleus, genetic information is copied into molecules of mRNA and sent out into the cytoplasm. This information is used to manufacture Protein

---

It is enclosed by a double membrane called the nucleur envelope

Openings in the nuclear envelope called nucleur pores allow for movement of substances in and out of the nucleus

Structures inside the nucleus that contain DNA and proteins are called Ribosomes

DNA = Deoxyribonucleic acid
