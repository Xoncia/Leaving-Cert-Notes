## **Semi-state bodies: privatisation/nationalisation**

### **Privatisation**

Privatisation is the selling of a state-owned company to private investors. The sale raises money for the government, but they then lose control over the service.

**Advantages:**

- More efficient
- More access to finance
- May lead to increased competition

**Disadvantages:**

- Loss of control over the service
- May lead to job losses
- Business may reduce services (now profit-driven)

### **Nationalisation**

Nationalisation is when a privately run business is taken over and run by the state. This happens when a business/industry cannot support itself, and the government deems it an essential service for citizens. The government buys to save the business/industry so that services can be maintained.
