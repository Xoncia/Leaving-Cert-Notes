# Sean Nós Singing

Sean Nós singing is the traditional Irish style of singing in Ireland

Sean Nós means "old style"

It is a style of singing dating back hundreds of years, which was handed down orally (through ear/listening) from generation to generation. It is a really good example of "pure" traditional Irish music. The words of the songs are very important, the words tell the story. Rhythm is dictated by speech rhythms. Singers will sometimes often speak the last few words of the song
