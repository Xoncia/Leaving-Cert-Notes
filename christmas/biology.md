## Tips for the Christmas and State Exam

- Don't use Tippex - Put a line through the cancelled answer and give an alternative answer, then if the cancelled answer is correct, you get the marks
- If you give two answers - a wrong answer cancels a correct answer - **don't do this**
- **Tick off questions and parts of questions as you complete them - easy to leave out parts under pressure**
- Remember answers are generally awarded 3 marks (describe/explain questions - you can estimate the number of points required by dividing the remainder of the question by 3 and seeing how many marks are left)
  - **For example,** if the question has 30 marks - most likely give 10 pieces of information
- Start each questions on a new page
- In the real exam don't ask for extra pages (There are 39 pages in the Part C Booklet) - Extra pages can get lost during scanning
- There is no need to use graph paper in the State exam

**Spend 5-10 minutes choosing Questions and highlighting key words**
