# Leaving Cert Notes
[Github Pages](https://cutthroat78.github.io/Leaving-Cert-Notes/)

This is my repo of notes for the Leaving Cert

I will no longer be working on this repo, when I take my exams in 2023

If you would like to add any notes, make any suggestions or simply want to help in anyways, create an issue

When I am no longer working on this repo but you want to make changes or modify the notes for yourself, I would recommend forking this repo and working on it there. I suggest that you keep the forked repo public to allow other to use the notes and help contribute to them

Add ```<!--In Anki-->``` to any title that it's content has been converted to anki

Add ```<!--No Anki-->``` to any title that isn't to be converted to anki
