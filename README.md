[Github Pages](https://cutthroat78.github.io/Leaving-Cert-Notes/)

This is my repo of notes for the leaving cert

I will no longer be working on this repo, when I take my exams in 2023

If you would like to add any notes, make any suggestions or simply want to help in anyways, create an issue

When I am no longer working on this repo but you want to make changes or modify the notes for yourself, please fork this repo and work on it there. I suggest that you keep the forked repo public to allow other to use the notes and help contribute to them
