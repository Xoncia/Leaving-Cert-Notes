# Leaving Cert Notes
[Github Pages](https://cutthroat78.github.io/Leaving-Cert-Notes/)

This is my repo of notes for the Leaving Cert

I will no longer be working on this repo, when I take my exams in 2023

If you would like to add any notes, make any suggestions or simply want to help in anyways, create an issue

When I am no longer working on this repo but you want to make changes or modify the notes for yourself, I would recommend forking this repo and working on it there. I suggest that you keep the forked repo public to allow other to use the notes and help contribute to them

Add ```<!--In Anki-->``` to any title that it's content has been converted to anki

## Links to help make/edit notes
- [Line Graph Maker](https://www.rapidtables.com/tools/line-graph.html)
## Plan
1. Convert, setup and fix the notion export and sort all that out
  - Biology
  - Biology Experiments
  - Computer science
  - English
  - Music
2. Convert paper and all other notes into digital
3. Fix and put all links into index.md
4. Convert all Biology paper and digital slides
5. Start converting all notes to anki
  - Convert tables to standard cards (with or without reverse), if the table is hard to study with standard cards use cloze cards
  - Sentences of info use cloze cards, if info doesn't really work with cloze try making the info into a question and answer and turn the question and answer into a standard card
  - Use image occlusion cards to learn diagrams
## To Dos
- Get rid of summer exam files and links in {subject}.md files after exams are done
- Try and get rid of sub title on github pages website, so the top takes up less space
- Find out how to link to certain parts of same and other pages, so that I can make key words and words in leaving cert notes link to other pages and parts of pages (So if you can't remember what a term means you can re-read what it means)
