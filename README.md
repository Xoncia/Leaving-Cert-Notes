# Leaving Cert Notes
[Github Pages](https://cutthroat78.github.io/Leaving-Cert-Notes/)

This is my repo of notes and anki decks for the Leaving Cert

This repo will be archived, when I take my exams in 2023

If you would like to add any notes, make any suggestions or simply want to help in anyways, create an issue

When I am no longer working on this repo but you want to make changes or modify the notes for yourself, I would recommend forking this repo and working on it there. I suggest that you keep the forked repo public to allow other to use the notes and help contribute to them
