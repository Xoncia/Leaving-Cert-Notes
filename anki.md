- Add â˜† to converted pages and pieces of pages
- Rather than making own anki decks. Make anki decks a collection of other peoples notes and some of my own
- Later on sort all of the cards in each subject to make things more affective and have an **ultimate** deck
- Idea: Convert previous exam paper questions into anki decks

List of search terms to try and find as many anki decks as possible:

- By subject
- By topic (in a subject)
- "leaving"
- "leaving cert"
- "leaving certificate"
- "certificate"
- "cert"
- "lc"
- "HL"
- "Higher Level"
- "Higher"

Good places for cards:

- [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/)
- [Anki Decks | Buy or Sell](https://ankidecks.com/decks)
- [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/)
- [AnkiWeb - Shared Decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/)
- [Brainscape](https://www.brainscape.com/) (If I can find a program that can convert or get pro version (with pro duplicate cards and then export duplicate as csv))
