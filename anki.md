# Anki
- Add â˜† to converted pages and pieces of pages
- Rather than making own anki decks. Make anki decks a collection of other peoples notes and some of my own
- Later on sort all of the cards in each subject to make things more affective and have an **ultimate** deck
- Idea: Convert previous exam paper questions into anki decks
